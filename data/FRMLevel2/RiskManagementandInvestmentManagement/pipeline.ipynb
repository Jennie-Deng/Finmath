As a result, GV’s stock price\\ndeclined sharply while LM’s stock price rose dramatically.

The initial surplus\\nis calculated as S0 =A0 – L0 = 350 – 180 = 170, where A0 = thefirm’s initial assets and L0\\nthe firm’s initial liabilities.Next we have to calculate the surplus at the end of 2008.Given\\nthe 50% decline in the equity market, the new level of assets A1 at theend of 2008 is equal to:\\n(1 – 0.5) * 350, or 175The new level of liabilities L1 can be calculated as:L1 = (1 – (MD *\\nΔy)) * L0where MD is the modified duration, and Δy is the change in yield.Liabilities at end\\nof 2008 are equal to:L1= (1 – (14 * -0.02)) * 180 = 230.4. Therefore, the 2008 surplus S1 is\\nequal to A1 – L1 = 175 – 230.4 = -55.4 (which implies the pension fund isactually in a\\ndeficit situation at the end of 2008). The change in surplus for2008 is hence S1 – S0 = -55.4\\n– 170 = -225.4 million.(6)',\n",
