1.Jack, a graduate student at Mary Business School, attended a job interview for the position
of fixed-income-security researcher. After the interview, the department manager replied that
Jack lacked the basic knowledge of fixed-income securities. Jack recalled the conversation and
found some of the following statements he said might be wrong.Statement 1: Debenture bonds have
less risks than collateral trust bonds, since only high-rating companies can issue debenture
bonds. Statement 2: Guaranteed bonds rank undoubtedly above collateral trust bonds, because
collaterals may devaluate as time passes, while guarantor is almost sure to pay for the debts
if the guarantee fails to pay.Statement 3: Bonds issued by highly creditworthy firms generally
contain few covenants.Statement 4: Call provisions benefit bond issuers, while put provisions
benefit bondholders.Which of these statement（　） is (are) wrong?
A.Statement 1 and Statement 3
B.Statement 1 and Statement 2
C.Statement 2 and Statement 4
D.Statement 3 and Statement 4
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】本题的考点为不同抵押类型债券的性质辨析。Statement 1: collateral trust bonds （抵押
信托债券）是有金融资产作为抵押品的债券，当发生违约时，可以对抵押品进行清算从而获得违约的补偿。
与 collateral trust bonds（担保信托债券）不同，Debenture bonds（无抵押债券）是没有抵押品的，因
此面临的风险是高于抵押信托债券的。Statement 1是错误的。Statement 2: guaranteed bonds（担保债券
）的担保效果和债券发行人与担保人之间的财务相关性息息相关，因为如果债券发行人和担保人之间的财务
相关性比较大，那么发行人发生违约的时候，担保人的财务状况也表现很差，那么有可能这个时候担保人也
没有能力履行担保职责从而偿付款项。反之，相关性越小担保效果越好。不能简单一味地认为提供担保的第
三方就有能力履行担保职责。Statement 2是错误的。Statement 3: 债券契约中会有三类条款，规定发行人
必须做到的积极条款（positive covenants），禁止某些行为的消极条款（negative covenants），还有维
持财务指标的财务条款（financial covenants），一个公司信用质量越好，契约中所含的条款就会越少。
Statement 3 是正确的。Statement 4: Call provisions（赎回条款）允许发行人在一定时间以一定价格赎
回债券，这对发行人有利；而put provisions（回售条款）则让债券持有人有权在特定日期以预先确定的价
格将债券卖回给发行人，这对债券持有人有利。Statement 4是正确的。因此，选项B正确。

9.Sunny is a manager of a hedge fund called Bright Futures, specializing in fixed income
securities. One day, Bright Futures hosted a workshop and invited all the mid-level executives
and management trainees. The workshop provided a platform for sharing ideas, and Sunny took
some notes when others shared their opinions.Statement 1: Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate)
is a secured borrowing rate between banks, which is quoted for several different currencies and
for borrowing periods ranging from one day to one year.Statement 2: Libor is not an ideal
benchmark because it is based on estimates that can be manipulated, while repo-based secured
overnight financing rateis a better choice.Statement 3: The liquidity preference theory argues
that forward rates should be equal to expected future spot rates.Statement 4: If there is no
default and the yield keepsconstant, the bond price approaches par value as its time-to-
maturity approaches zero.Which of these statement（　） is (are) wrong?
A.Statement 1 and Statement 3
B.Statement 2 and Statement 3
C.Statement 1 and Statement 4
D.Statement 2 and Statement 4
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】本题的考点为LIBOR、利率期限结构理论和回归面值效应（pull-to-par effect）。Statement
1：LIBOR是一个报价利率，可以被操纵，是一个unsecured的利率。statement 1是错误的。Statement
2：LIBOR 是一个报价利率，可以被操纵。美国提议采用repo-based secured overnight financing
rate，也就是隔夜回购利率（SOFR），而英国和欧元区则提议分别采用英镑隔夜指数平均利率（SONIA）和欧
元隔夜指数平均利率（EONIA）。Statement 2 是正确的。Statement 3：预期理论认为，利率期限结构反映
了市场对未来利率的预期，远期利率应等于未来即期利率的预期值。Statement 3是错误的。Statement
4：回归面值效应（pull-to-par effect）认为，如果没有违约且收益率保持不变的情况下，随着时间不断趋
近到期日，债券价格不断趋近面值。Statement 4 是正确的。因此，选项A正确。
 
10.Robert Rubin, former Treasury Secretary, decided to stop issuing 30-year Treasury bonds in
2001 and to replace them by borrowing more with shorter-maturity Treasury bills and notes.
Which of the following statements concerning this decision is most accurate?
A.If the expectation theory of the term structure is correct, this decision will reduce the
government's borrowing cost.
B.If the liquidity preference theory of the term structure is correct, this decision will
reduce the government's borrowing cost.
C.If the liquidity preference theory of the term structure is correct, this decision will not
change the government's borrowing cost.
D.If the expectation theory of the term structure is correct, this decision will increase the
government's borrowing cost.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】本题的考点为对利率期限理论和预期理论的理解。如果预期理论是正确的，那么市场中的远期
利率应当等于市场对未来即期利率的预期值，题目中没有提及到预期的问题，无法判断长期利率与短期利率
的大小关系。因此，选项A和D与题意无关。如果流动性偏好理论是正确的，在流动性偏好理论下，贷款人偏
好短期的产品，借款人偏好长期的产品。借贷双方难以达成交易。做市商为了撮合两方的需求，便调高长期
利率，调低短期利率，这样贷款人便有动力选择更加长期的产品，而借款人也有动力选择期限更短的产品
，因而最终利率期限结构成为向上倾斜的形状，即短期借款利率低于长期借款利率。所以，政府的借款从长
期变为短期，成本将会下降。因此，选项C错误，选项B正确。

12.Lucy is a senior investment adviser who works at Morning Star Securities. She notices that
the spot rate curve is currently upward-sloping and expects the term structure won’t change
too much in the future. There are two actively traded Treasury Bonds in the market, Bond A and
Bond B. They have the same maturity, but Bond A has a higher coupon rate than Bond B. According
to the information above, what conclusion can Lucy draw?
A.Bond A has a higher YTM.
B.Bond B has a higher YTM.
C.Bond A and Bond B has the same YTM, because the difference in coupon rates has already
reflected in their prices.
D.Other information is still needed before drawing an approximate conclusion.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】本题的考点为票息效应。根据票息效应，相同期限但不同票息的公平定价的债券的YTM是不同的
。当即期利率曲线向上倾斜时，YTM与票息率呈现负相关。债券A的票息率高于债券B，债券A的YTM更小，债券
B的YTM更大。因此，选项B正确。

18.Terence, a Professor at HaWhite University, is taking a course in risk management. After
introducing two concepts about “DVDZ (DV01 for zero rates)” and “Effective duration”, the
students begin to be confused. Brandon,one of the students, raises his hand to ask a question:
“Both concepts are used to measure the impact of the rate changes on the value of a position.
What are their different application scenarios?” Terence give a very detailed explanation,
which could be summarized as the following:Statement I: When the size of a position of the
portfolio increases, both the effective duration and DVDZ will increase.Statement II:Abond
investor is often interested in returns. A large percentage change can easily alert a bond
investor. From this point of view, DV01 would be more useful than effective duration.Statement
III: An investor’s portfolio has a DVDZ of $250. There isa5-year bond available for hedging.
Assume that 5-year bonds with one million market value has DVDZ of 150 is available to hedge
the investor’s portfolio, the USD value of the bond position for hedging is

20.Two colleagues are discussing the convexity of different bonds:Wendy’s opinion: when
interest rate declines, putable bonds show higher convexity than the otherwise identical
straight bonds (with the same coupon, maturity, issuer, credit rating, etc.).Jackson’s
opinion: when interest rate declines, callable bonds show higher convexity than the otherwise
identical straight bonds but tend to show negative convexity when interest rate rises.Which of
the above statements is/are TRUE?
A.Both of them
B.Neither of them
C.Wendy\u2019s
D.Jackson\u2019s
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】本题的考点为利率下降时对可赎回债券和可回售债券的凸度影响。利率下降，可赎回债券
(callable)呈现出负凸性；利率上升，可回售债券(putable)呈现出更高的凸性。Wendy的观点，认为利率下
降时，可回售债券呈现出更高的凸性，错误。Jackson的观点，认为利率下降时，可赎回债券呈现出更高的凸
性，利率上升，可赎回债券呈现出负凸性，更加错误。因此，选项B正确。
 
21.Thomas is a professor of Finance. One day, he prepared a quick quiz about fixed income
securities for his students.Statement I: Macaulay duration cannot be used for bonds with
embedded options.Statement II: When interest rates decrease, the bond with larger convexity

bullet portfolio, assuming these two portfolios have the same duration.Statement IV: DV01 is
the money change in full price of a bond when its yield changes by 0.1%.Which of the above
statements is (are) correct?
A.I
B.I, II
C.I, II, III
D.All
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】本题的考点为债券久期与凸度相关知识的概念辨析。陈述I:：收益率久期，诸如麦考利久期、
修正久期和美元久期，都是不可用于含权债券久期的计算的，因此正确。陈述II：凸度的特点为“涨多跌少
”，因此在利率下降时，凸度更大的债券获益更多。陈述III：有相同久期的债券，现金流越分散，其凸度越
大，即杠铃式债券组合的凸度应大于子弹式债券组合，因此错误。陈述IV：DV01是指当利率变化1个bp，即
0.01%时债券价值的变化额，因此错误。陈述I和陈述II均正确，因此，选项B正确。
 
22.Jay, a risk consultant from Gloomberg Technology, is helping the company’s clients to
better understand a new functionality of the software that his company sells. The functionality
enables the clients to better monitor the risk from the unparalleled shift of the interest rate

functionality?
A.Key-rate 01\u2019s
B.Forward-bucket 01\u2019s
C.Key-rate duration
D.DV01
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】本题的考点为利率曲线非平行移动的衡量测度。选项A中Key-rate 01’s表示当关键利率变动
1个bp时债券价格的变动值。选项B中Forward-bucket 01’s表示远期利率期限结构中某一段远期利率变动1个
bp时债券价格的变动值。选项C中Key-rate duration表示当关键利率发生变化时债券价格变动的百分比。选
项D中DV01表示当利率曲线整体平行移动1个bp时债券价值的变动值。选项A,B,C中描述的久期都属于利率曲线
非平行移动时的风险测度，选项D属于利率曲线平行移动的风险测度。因此，选项D正确。

24.Leo, FRM, is a risk manager of a hedge fund. He doubted the effectiveness of duration and
convexity hedging strategies. Instead, he found that key rate hedging is a more practical one.
His intern, Amy, showed him some materials about key rate hedging strategies that she gathered.
Leo was pleased with the materials, but there are still some mistakes. Which one of them is
incorrect?
A.The analysis of key rate duration applies principal components analysis. Based on the PCA,
the daily term structure movements observed are a linear combination of the factors, which are
correlated.
B.The first three factors account for the majority of the variation of the observed rate daily
movements, which can be roughly seen as a parallel shift in the term structure, a steepening or
flattening of the term structure, and a bowing of the term structure.
C.Key rate shifts assume that the impact of the key rate shifts declines (or increases)
linearly and reaches zero at the terms of the adjacent key rates.
D.If 2-year, 7-year and 15-year are selected as the key rates, and the 7-year key rate rises
one basis point, the 5-year rate will increase by 0.6 basis point.

assets (MBS). Securitization increase the liquidity of financial assets. Which of the following
is right about securitization?
A.MPS redistributes the cash flows from a mortgage pool to different tranches.
B.CMO is the simplest form of agency MBSs, with all investors in a pool receiving the same
return.
C.As prepayments increase, IOs become less valuable.
D.As prepayments increase, POs become less valuable.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】本题的考点为MBS,MPS,IO,PO知识点的辨析。选项A中，CMO才对房贷池中的现金流进行了分层而
不是MPS，因此错误。选项B中，MPS才是agency MBS中最简单的形式而不是CMO，因此错误。选项C中，当提前
还款增加时，意味着未偿付的本金减少，则基于未偿付本金计算的利息也减少，IOs的价值会降低。选项D中
，随着提前还款增加，PO可以提前收回现金流，价值更大而非更小，因此错误。因此，选项C正确。
 
28.MBS is one of the most popular financial instruments in today’s world. Some comments about
the MBS are shown below. Which one of them is incorrect?
A.Unlike specific pools, TBA allows buyers and sellers to trade a certain kind of pool.
B.Specific pools market is more liquid than the TBA market.
C.Unlike repo, the dollar roll trader could be returned with different pools.
D.Interest is added to price during a repo transaction, while it is not the case for a dollar
roll transaction.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】本题的考点为TBA,repo,specified pool等概念辨析。选项A中，specified pool最终交割是一
个确定的资产池，而TBA可交割的一类资产池而非特定资产池，因此正确。选项B中，由于TBA市场是一个远期
市场，可交割的资产池并不是特定的资产池而是符合条件的一类资产池，流动性比specified pool更好，因
此错误。选项C中，repo是需要回购特定的资产池的，而dollar roll是基于TBA的，最终交割的可以是不一样
的资产池，因此正确。选项D中，repo交易中收益率往往是在出售和回购价差中体现的，而dollar roll的收
益并不只考虑价差，因此正确。选项A,C,D表述均正确，不符合题意，因此选项B为本题正确答案。

A.If FRA rate is lower than future spot rate, the short position will receive payments.
B.An FRA is usually settled at the beginning of the period covered by the FRA.
C.The FRA can be used to lock the interest rate or hedge the risk of borrowing or lending at
some future dates.
D.Short positions in FRA can be viewed as the obligation to make a loan at the contract rate,
and would benefit if reference rate decreases.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】本题的考点为FRA相关性质的辨析。选项A中，FRA中的多头方可以看作未来将以一个固定的合约
利率借入款项的债务人角色，在未来借款利率上升时可获利，空头为亏损的一方，需要支付款项给多头方
，因此错误。选项B中，FRA的结算是在其所覆盖的借款期开始时就进行的，因此正确。选项C中，FRA可以确
定未来的借款利率，对于borrower可以对冲利率上涨的风险，对于lender可以对冲利率下降的风险，因此正
确。选项D中，FRA的空头方是未来将以一个固定的利率借出款项的一方，当利率下降时可以获利，因此正确
。选项B,C,D表述均正确，不符合题意，因此选项A为本题正确答案。

35.For any portfolio P, let VaR (P, λ, t)denote its VaR, and ES (P, λ, t)denote its ES, with
confidence level λ over a horizon of t days. Which of the following relationships is always
true?
A.ES (P, \u03bb, t) \u2264 VaR (P, \u03bb, t)
B.VaR (P1 + P2, \u03bb, t) \u2264 VaR (P1, \u03bb, t) + VaR (P2, \u03bb, t)
C.ES (3\u00d7P, \u03bb, t) = 3\u00d7ES (P, \u03bb, t)
D.VaR (3\u00d7P, \u03bb, t) = 9\u00d7VaR (P, \u03bb, t)
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】本题的考点为满足一致性的风险测度指标。一个满足一致性的风险测度指标（a coherent risk
measure）要满足下面四个条件：• Monotonicity（单调性）: 优质资产的风险不会比劣质资产的要大•
Subadditivity（次可加性）: 组合的风险不会比部分风险加总大• Homogeneity（齐次性）: 成比例增加的
头寸的风险等于原来头寸的风险成比例增加• Translational invariance（转移不变性）: 加了现金或其他
无风险资产以后总头寸的风险会相较原来头寸的风险减少，减少的量恰好是其所增加的现金或无风险资产的
数量。VaR不是一个一致性的风险测度指标，因为不满足次可加性，所以B和D选项错误。ES 是尾部损失的期
望值，是满足一致性的风险测度指标，所以C选项正确，A选项错误。
 
36.If the daily, 90% confidence level, value-at-risk (VaR) of a portfolio is correctly
estimated to be USD 5,000, an investor would expect that in one out of ___ days, the portfolio
value will decline by USD 5,000 or ____:
A.ten, less.
B.ninety, less.
C.ten, more.
D.ninety, more.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】本题考点为VaR的定义。90%置信水平下的VaR是5,000美元，反映的是有90%的时间损失小于
5,000美元，即10天中有9天的时间损失小于5,000美元，也就等价于10天中有1天的时间损失大于5,000美元。
所以选择答案C。
 
37.Rational Investment Inc. is estimating a daily VaR for its fixed income portfolio, which is
currently valued at USD 800 million. Using daily returns of the last 400 days (in descending
sort: from highest daily return to lowest daily return), the daily returns are the following:
1.99%, 1.89% 1.88% 1.87% ……, -1.76%, -1.82%, -1.84%, -1.87%, -1.91%. At the 99% confidence
level, what is your estimate of the daily VaR using the historical simulation method with equal
weights?
A.USD 14.08 million
B.USD 14.56 million
C.USD 14.72 million
D.USD 15.04 million
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】本题考点为VaR的计算。根据历史400个数据，选择1%的分位点对应的损失，从最大的损失开始
选择第四个损失值就是对应的百分比的一天内的VaR，也就是-1.82%，通过与组合价值800 million相乘，可
以得到美元的VaR是14.56 million：。所以答案选择B选项。
 
38.A risk manager is estimating the 1-day 95% VaR on a domestic equity portfolio using a 100-
day lookback period. The return, estimated from the historical data, has a mean of 0% and a
standard deviation of 2%. The six most extreme negative returns over the lookback period, along
with the time they occurred, are:
Over a period of 10 days after the risk manager computed the portfolio’s VaR, four new extreme
declines occurred: -25%, -4.1%, -7.8% and -9.5%. On the other six days, the portfolio
experienced positive returns. The risk manager must now update the previous VaR estimate to
account for these changes. Assuming the portfolio has a current value of USD 100 million, what
is the updated 1-day 95% VaR using the historical approach with equal weights?
A.USD 3.28 million
B.USD 4.70 million
C.USD 10 million
D.USD 25 million
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】本题的考点为VaR的计算。经过更新四个新的极端损失后，把损失从大到小排序可以得到：-
25%，-9.5%，-7.8%，-6.3%，-4.7%，-4.1%。对应的是95%的一天的VaR值，总共数据100个，应该选择5%分位
点，也就是第五个数字-4.7%作为VaR。再计算美元的VaR就是4.7% 100 = 4.7 million.
 
39.A risk manager is measuring the VaR of a portfolio for a regional bank. The portfolio has a

40.Jenny Michaelson, a risk manager of Value Fund, predicts that the market will suffer a
significant change from bull to bear. Therefore, to control the risk she wants to measure the
risk level of Value Fund now. She has two options to measure the risk, VaR and Expected
shortfall. She could not decide which one to use or the ways to calculate the indicator. She
consulted her supervisor about the following statements. Which statements are
incorrect?Statement 1: VaR and Expected shortfall are both risk measures, so they both can
measure the tail risk of the portfolio.Statement 2: Under this circumstance, she can use
historical simulation to calculate VaR since historical simulation contains enough information
about previous prices and correlations.Statement 3: Under this circumstance, she can use Monte
Carlo simulation to calculate VaR since Monte Carlo simulation does not suffer model
risk.Statement 4: If the portfolio contains options, she can use the delta normal approach
without gamma correction to calculate accurate VaR.
A.Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4
B.Statement 2, Statement 3
C.Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4
D.All of the above four statements are incorrect.
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】Answer：D：本题主要考察VaR的计算方式以及VaR和Expected shortfall的对比。对于
Statement 1：Expected shortfall描述尾部亏损，但是VaR只是某一分位点的亏损，并没有描述整体尾部的
风险。而Statement I说的是VaR和Expected shortfall两个方法都均描述了尾部亏损。因此该描述错误。对
于Statement 2：历史模拟法包含了过去的价格和相关性信息是正确的。但是这道题表明，市场要从牛市变换
为熊市，因此未来和过去有很大的不同，不能简单的用过去来预测未来了，因此历史模拟法不再适用。因此
该描述错误。对于Statement 3：根据题意，市场要从牛市变换为熊市，而蒙特卡洛模拟是可以调整风险因子
的分布的，所以在这种情况下可以通过蒙特卡洛模拟来计算组合VaR值的。但是蒙特卡洛模拟需要先假定风险
因子的分布模型，因此会存在模型风险。因此该描述错误。对于Statement 4：VaR期权属于非线性衍生工具
，在用不带gamma修正的delta normal的方法计算VaR值会存在较大误差。因此该描述错误。综上所述，所有
Statements都是错误的。因此选项D正确。
 
41.A portfolio manager of an endowment wants to compare the VaR estimated from the delta-normal
approach to the one estimated from the historical simulation method with equal weights. The
€100,000,000 portfolio is restricted on using derivative securities. The daily return is
expected to be 0.04%, with a daily standard deviation of 0.95%. The manager uses a 2% level of
significance that has a z-value of 2.05. The manager also ranked the 250 daily returns of last
year from the highest to the lowest. The lowest six returns are -0.0191, -0.0259, -0.0311, -
0.0354, -0.0368, and -0.0384. What is the daily VaR using the delta-normal method compared to
the historical simulation method?
A.The delta-normal method estimate is the same as that of the historical simulation method.
B.The delta-normal method estimated VaR is €910,000.
C.The historical simulation method estimated VaR is €2,590,000.
D.The historical simulation method estimated VaR is €3,680,000.

43.Galvin, the head of Risk Department in Bank of Arctic, is discussing the pros and cons of
the bank’s current risk model with Jeff, the leader of the Quantitative Analytics Team in the
department. Jeff has made the following statements:I. The assumption of normality for asset
return is incorrect in whatever circumstances.II. The fat tail phenomena may be explained by
conditionally normally distributed returns.III. To capture time-varying volatility, a regime-
switching model always provides a better solution.Which of his statements is(are) correct?
A.I and II
B.II only
C.I and III
D.All
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】本题的考点为资产回报的分布。在条件分布的假设前提下，假设资产回报是服从正态分布是合
理的，只是可能在不同时期对应的正态分布的参数不同（例如，危机的时候所用正态分布方差这个参数更大
），这样的假设也很好的解释肥尾现象，所以I错误，II正确。去捕捉不同时期对应的波动率，机制转换
（regime-switching）模型和缓慢变换（slow-changing）模型都是可选的，并不是机制转换模型一定更好。
因此，答案选择B选项。
 
44.Which of the following statements on historical simulation with equal weights to estimate
VaR is (are) incorrect?I. It gives more weights to the more recent observations.II. For long-
only portfolios, it is likely to underestimate the VaR if there is recently an increase in the
volatility structure.III. It always ignores the presence of fat tails in the return
distribution of many financial assets.IV. Because of the incorporation of delta approximation,
it inadequately measures the risk of nonlinear instruments.
A.I and II
B.II only
C.I, III and IV
D.III and IV
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】本题的考点为等权重的历史模拟法。I错误，因为等权重历史模拟法赋予历史每一天的信息相同
的权重。II正确，因为等权重历史模拟法对过去一段时间每天的信息赋予相同的权重，所以没有办法迅速反
映出一个最新的波动率变化。所以对于一个波动率期限结构上升的情形，等权重历史模拟法估计出来的结果
会低估真实的情况。III错误。历史模拟法是非参数法，利用了历史数据，肥尾的情况已经直接反应在历史数
据中。由于没有假设分布，所以也就自然不会受到肥尾等因素的影响。IV历史模拟法不需要用的delta
approximation，这句话描述历史模拟法本来就是错误的。所以答案选择C选项。
 
45.Jaclynn, a risk analyst in JW Investment Associate, wanted to use the historical simulation
(with declining weights) to estimate the daily 5% VaR of one of the portfolios managed by the
company.She then gathered daily return for the past 100 days, ordered them in ascending order
and create the following table using λ = 0.97
Which of the following statements is incorrect?
A.The missing data in cell A is close to 0.00468.
B.The daily 5% VaR is somewhere between 0.07% and 0.15%.
C.If only using historical simulation with equal weights, the estimated VaR would be greater
than that estimated by the historical simulation with declining weights.
D.As time goes further to the past, a small λ is likely to make the weights decline slower.

46.Despite the violation of subadditivity, VaR is still widely used to measure the risk. There
are different ways of calculating VaR – historical simulation, delta normal approach, Monte
Carlo simulation and so on. Which one of the following is correct?
A.Historical simulation is a parametric method, using full revaluation to evaluate different
scenarios.
B.Although historical simulation uses historical data, it can still instantly reflect the new
volatility and correlation.
C.Delta normal approach is easy to use, and it gives accurate approximation of VaR of linear
derivatives, non- linear derivatives, and even MBS or exotic options.
D.Monte Carlo simulations can generate correlated scenarios and model the correlations among
different risk factors based on a statistical distribution, and it can work for both linear and
non-linear portfolio.
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】本题的考点为计算VaR的方法之间的差异。通过假设的分布，蒙特卡洛模拟可以生成不同的情景
，并且可以反映风险因子之间的相关性，因此D选项正确。对于A选项，历史模拟法是一种非参数方法，我们
并不需要估计参数从而确定分布，因此该选项错误。对于B选项，历史模拟法的缺点之一是不能很快反映市场
当中的新信息，因此该选项错误。对于C选项，Delta normal approach容易使用，对于线性衍生品的VaR可以
给出精确的结果，但当计算对象成为非线性衍生品、MBS、奇异期权时，其结果将会变得非常不可靠，因此该
选项错误。 (1)
 
47.A risk analyst hesitates to use EWMA or GARCH model in the risk control system and asks
opinions from his manager, David Hine. David suggests that the estimated variance of the EWMA
model consists of the squared return of the prior period and the estimated variance of the
prior period; the weight assigned to the squared return decays at a speed of λ as the time
lapses. David also says that the GARCH (1,1) model incorporates the mean reversion that the
speed of reverting to the long-run variance goes up as the persistence factor(α+β) gets
small. Is David’s opinion on the two models correct?
A.Yes.
B.No, because the estimated variance of the EWMA model consists of the squared return of the
prior period, the variance of the prior period and the long-run variance.
C.No, because the weight assigned to the squared return decays at a speed of 1-\u03bb as the
time lapses.
D.No, because the speed of the GARCH model reverting to the long-run variance goes up as the
persistence factor (\u03b1+\u03b2) gets large.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】本题考点为EWMA模型和GARCH (1,1)模型的辨析。David关于两个模型的描述均正确。EWMA模型
在计算时包含了历史的回报的平方，并且离现在越久远的回报的平方权重以λ为指数递减。由于在模型中加
入了长期方差，因此GARCH (1,1)模型具有均值复归水平。而且，+被称为Persistence Level，其数值大小与
均值复归速度呈反向关系。因此，两个描述均正确。

，使用对数正态分布对损失的严重程度进行建模，II刚好错误地将两种分布的运用场景进行对换，因此II错
误。最终应当选择D选项。
 
64.Ming, a risk analyst for Evergrand Investment Advisor, is analyzing the annual reports of
Bank of Huge (BoH), an international bank with business across major regions in the world. He
gathered the past three-years of annual gross income data for BoH across different lines of
business:
Based on the table above, he makes several statements on the capital requirements on BoH’s
operational risk:I. Using the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA), the operational risk capital
requirements for BoH in 2019 is calculated as USD 265.8 billion.II. The operational risk
capital requirements for BoH calculated based on Standardized Approach (SA) is less than that
from the Basic Indicator Approach.III. BoH can choose to use the Advanced Measurement Approach
(AMA) for its operational risk capital requirement calculation given its size and complexity of
business. However, the loss severity and loss frequency would need to be modeled.Which of the
above statement（　） is(are) true?
A.I and III
B.II and III
C.Only I
D.All of them
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】本题的考点为操作风险的度量模型的辨析。如果使用BIA模型，在没有出现毛利润为负的情况下
，过去三年的平均毛利润乘以15%可以计算出资本的数额。在2018年: 毛利润= 380 + 712 + 846 = USD 1938
billion。类似的，2017、2016年的毛利润分别为USD 1766 billion、USD 1612 billion。近三年的平均毛利
润为 USD 1,772 billion。操作风险资本要求为1,772×15% =USD 265.8 billion. 因此I正确。如果使用
SA模型，不同的业务条线的毛利润所乘的比例不同。零售银行业务、商业银行业务和销售交易的比例分别为
12%、15%以及18%。2018: 0.12×380+0.15×712+0.18×846 = USD 304.68 billion2017:
0.12×344+0.15×645+0.18×777 = USD 277.89 billion2016: 0.12×326+0.15×599+0.18×687 = USD
252.63 billion操作风险资本的要求为:(304.68+277.89+252.63) / 3 = USD 278.4 billion。 SA模型计算
出的结果要比BIA模型所计算的结果要更大。 因此II错误。如果使用AMA模型计算操作风险资本，需要对损失
的发生频率和损失的严重程度进行建模，从而生成损失的分布。因此III正确。
 
65.Jacky is a senior manager in risk management at the Moon Bank. He asked Lucy, a new risk
analyst to conduct the stress test for the bank. He gave the stress test instructions left by
the last leaving risk analyst to Lucy. Jacky summarized some of the key points in the guide.
Which of the following statement is not correct?
A.Bank should have sufficient liquid assets and capital to survive various adverse events.
B.The reason why banks use reverse stress tests is to find events that could lead to the crash
of the bank.
C.Extreme events tend to have a moderate impact on the banking system, but there is a high
probability that these events will happen.
D.The time horizon for stress testing should be long enough for the full impact of scenarios to
be evaluated, and very long scenarios can be necessary for some situations.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Answer: C：本题考点为压力测试（stress testing）的原理和压力测试的关键要素。对于选项
A，压力测试是一种评估极端市场情形对银行影响的方法，该方法通过估计金融机构面临极端情景的表现，从
而判断其是否有充足的资本金和流动性资产以抵御这些极端市场情形。所以，该选项描述正确，不符合题意
，为错误选项。对于选项B，反向压力测试分析的是哪些极端情景导致了金融机构的失败。所以，该选项描述
正确，不符合题意，为错误选项。对于选项C，极端事件往往会对银行系统产生严重的影响，虽然这些事件发
生的可能性会很小。所以，该选项描述错误，符合题意，为正确选项。对于选项D，在压力测试的关键要素中
，情景选择是关键的要素之一。情景选择第一步是确定一个合适的时间跨度。这个时间跨度要足够长，以评
估情景的全面影响。常见的时间跨度为3个月到2年不等。有的可能会更长，长达几十年的时间跨度，例如一
些养老金计划，或者保险公司。所以，该选项描述正确，不符合题意，为错误选项。因此，正确选项为C。
