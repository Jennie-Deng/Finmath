In a well-diversified portfolio (where one is normally only concerned with systematic risk), it can be assumed that the correlation coefficient is close to 1, therefore beta can be approximated to an even simpler equation: $$T_P = \\frac{E(R_p) - R_f}{\\beta_P}$$ In either case, beta explains the volatility of the portfolio compared to the volatility of the market, which captures only systematic risk. The Treynor ratio is the correct ratio to use in this case. The formula is: which describes the difference between the expected return of the portfolio, $E(R_p)$ and the risk free rate $R_f$ divided by the portfolio beta $\\beta_P$.

This does not mean that they will give a higher return over all intervals of time. In fact, if they always gave a higher return, they would be less risky, not more risky, than low-beta stocks. Rather, because they are more risky, they will sometimes produce lower returns. However, over long periods of time, they should on the average produce higher returns. C is false and it is important in the CAPM. One of the greatest insights that comes from this equation arises from what it states is unimportant in determining return.
