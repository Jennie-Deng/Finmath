Subordinated debt has priority\nafter senior debt butahead of equity. Therefore, the subordinated claim is between senior debt,\nF,and total debt, F + U. It follows that the subordinated debt can be modeled bya long call\noption with strike price = F and a short call with strike price = F+ U (not U). Statement c is\ncorrect. During financial distress, the equity valueis relatively small, and the subordinated\ndebt claim behaves more like equityas it is closer to receiving \u201cresidual\u201d cash flows.\nSimilarly, when the firmvalue is relatively high, the subordinated debt claim behaves more like\ntraditionaldebt.",

McNeil's primary responsibility is\\nrisk management. Katrina Falk, a recently hired junior analyst at Farmhouse, works for McNeil\\nin managing the risk of the firm's commodity price exposures. Farmhouse's risk management\\npolicy requires the use of futures to protect revenue from price volatility, regardless of\\nforecasts of future prices, and prohibits risk managers from taking speculative\\npositions.McNeil meets with Falk to discuss recent developments in two of Farmhouse's commodity\\nmarkets, grains and livestock. McNeil asks Falk about key characteristics of the two markets\\nthat affect revenues and costs. Falk tells McNeil the following:Statement 1 The life cycle for\\nlivestock depends on the product and varies widely by product.Statement 2 Grains have uniform,\\nwell-defined seasons and growth cycles specific to geographic regions.A material portion of\\nFarmhouse's revenue comes from livestock exports, and a major input cost is the cost of grains\\nimported from outside the United States. Falk and McNeil next discuss three conclusions that\\nFalk reached in an analysis of the grains and livestock markets:Conclusion 1 Assuming demand\\nfor grains remains constant, extreme heat in the regions from which we import our grains will\\nresult in a benefit to us in the form of lower grain prices.Conclusion 2 New tariffs on cattle\\nintroduced in our primary export markets will likely result in higher prices for our livestock\\nproducts in our local market.Conclusion 3 Major improvements in freezing technology allowing\\nfor longer storage will let us better manage the volatility in the prices of our livestock\\nproducts.McNeil asks Falk to gather spot and futures price data on live cattle, wheat, and\\nsoybeans, which are presented in Exhibit 1. Additionally, she observes that (1) the convenience\\nyield of soybeans exceeds the costs of its direct storage and (2) commod-ity producers as a\\ngroup are less interested in hedging in the forward market than commodity consumers are.\\nA key input cost for Farmhouse in producing ethanol is natural gas. McNeil uses positions in\\nnatural gas (NG) futures contracts to manage the risk of natural gas price volatility. Three\\nmonths ago, she entered into a long position in natural gas futures at a futures price of $2.93\\nper million British thermal units (MMBtu). The current price of the same contract is $2.99.\\nExhibit 2 presents additional data about the three-month futures position.\\nThe futures position is fully collateralized with a 3% rate. McNeil decides to roll forward her\\ncurrent exposure in the natural gas position.Each month, McNeil reports the performance of the\\nenergy futures positions, including details on price returns, roll returns, and collateral\\nreturns, to the firm's executive committee. A new committee member is concerned about the\\nnegative roll returns on some of the positions. In a memo to McNeil, the committee member asks\\nher to explain why she is not avoiding positions with negative roll returns.\\n \"]",

According to this\nhypothesis, hedging pressure occurs when both producers and consumers seek to protect\nthemselves from commodity market price volatility by entering into price hedges to stabilize\ntheir projected profits and cash flows. If consumers are more interested in hedging than\nproducers are, the futures price will exceed the spot price.In contrast, the insurance theory\npredicts that the futures price has to be lower than the current spot price as a form of\npayment or remuneration to the speculator who takes on the price risk and provides price\ninsurance to the commodity seller. Similarly, the theory of storage also predicts that when a\ncommodity's convenience yield is greater than its direct storage costs, the futures price will\nbe lower than the spot price.",

Nabli also expects the level of the ICE Brent Index to\\nincrease from its current level. Nabli and Yamata discuss how to use swaps to take advantage of\\nNabli's expectations. The possible positions are (1) a basis swap long on Brent crude oil and\\nshort on heavy crude oil, (2) a long volatility swap on Brent crude oil, and (3) a short\\nposition in an excess return swap that is based on a fixed level (i.e., the current level) of\\nthe ICE Brent Index.\\n \"]",

Brady is considering an allocation of the pension system\u2019s assets to private equity.\\nShe has asked two of her analysts, Jennifer Chau, CFA, and Matthew Hermansky, to provide more\\ninformation about the workings of the private equity market.\\nBrady recognizes that the private equity asset class covers a broad spectrum of equity\\ninvestments that are not traded in public markets. She asks Chau to describe the major\\ndifferences between assets within this asset class. Chau notes that private equity ranges from\\nventure capital financing of early-stage companies to complete buyouts of large publicly traded\\nor even privately held companies. Chau describes some of the characteristics of venture capital\\nand buyout investments.\\nChau mentions that private equity firms take care to align the economic interests of the\\nmanagers of the investments they control with their own. Various contractual clauses are\\ninserted in the compensation contracts of the management team in order to reward or punish\\nmanagers who meet or do not meet agreed-upon target objectives.\\nOne concern Chau highlights is the illiquidity of private equity investments over time. Some\\nfunds are returned to investors, however, over the life of the fund because a number of\\ninvestment opportunities are exited early.

        "share_context": "['Martha Brady is the CIO of the Upper Darby County (UDC) public employees\u2019 pension\\nsystem. Brady is considering an allocation of the pension system\u2019s assets to private equity.\\nShe has asked two of her analysts, Jennifer Chau, CFA, and Matthew Hermansky, to provide more\\ninformation about the workings of the private equity market.\\nBrady recognizes that the private equity asset class covers a broad spectrum of equity\\ninvestments that are not traded in public markets. She asks Chau to describe the major\\ndifferences between assets within this asset class. Chau notes that private equity ranges from\\nventure capital financing of early-stage companies to complete buyouts of large publicly traded\\nor even privately held companies. Chau describes some of the characteristics of venture capital\\nand buyout investments.\\nChau mentions that private equity firms take care to align the economic interests of the\\nmanagers of the investments they control with their own. Various contractual clauses are\\ninserted in the compensation contracts of the management team in order to reward or punish\\nmanagers who meet or do not meet agreed-upon target objectives.\\nOne concern Chau highlights is the illiquidity of private equity investments over time. Some\\nfunds are returned to investors, however, over the life of the fund because a number of\\ninvestment opportunities are exited early. Provisions in a fund\u2019s prospectus describe the\\ndistribution of returns to investors, some of which favor the limited partners. One such\\nprovision is the distribution waterfall mechanism that provides distributions to limited\\npartners (LPs) before the general partner (GP) receives the carried interest. This distribution\\nmechanism is called the total return waterfall.\\nChau prepares the following data to illustrate the distribution waterfall mechanism and the\\nfunds provided to limited partners when a private equity fund with a zero hurdle rate exits\\nfrom its first three projects during a three-year period.\\nChau cautions that investors must understand the terminology used to describe the performance\\nof private equity funds. Interpretation of performance numbers should be made with the\\nawareness that much of the fund assets are illiquid during a substantial part of the fund\u2019s\\nlife. She provides the latest data in Exhibit 2 for the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Funds,\\ndiversified high-technology venture capital funds formed five years ago, each with five years\\nremaining to termination.\\nChau studies the data and comments, Of the three funds, the Alpha Fund has the best chance to\\noutperform over the remaining life. First, it\u2019s because the management has earned such a\\nrelatively high residual value on capital and will be able to earn a high return on the\\nremaining funds called down. At termination, the RVPI will be double the 0.65 value when the\\nrest of the funds are called down. Second, its cash-on-cash return as measured by DPI is\\nalready as high as that of the Beta Fund. The PIC (or paid-in capital) ratio indicates the\\nproportion of capital already called by the GP. The PIC of Alpha is relatively low relative to\\nBeta and Gamma.\\nHermansky notes that a private equity fund\u2019s ability to properly plan and execute its exit\\nfrom an investment is vital for the fund\u2019s success. Venture funds, such as Alpha, Beta, and\\nGamma, take special care to plan their exits.\\nBrady then asks the analysts what procedures private equity firms would use to value\\ninvestments in their portfolios as well as investments that are added later. She is concerned\\nabout buying into a fund with existing assets that do not have public market prices that can be\\nused to ascertain value. In such cases, she worries, what if a GP overvalues the assets and new\\ninvestors in the fund pay more for the fund assets than they are worth?\\nHermansky makes three statements regarding the valuation methods used in private equity\\ntransactions during the early stages of selling a fund to investors.\\nStatement 1: For venture capital investment in the early stages of analysis, emphasis is placed\\non the discounted cash flow approach to valuation.\\nStatement 2: For buyout investments, income-based approaches are used frequently as a primary\\nmethod of valuation.\\nStatement 3: If a comparable group of companies exist, multiples of revenues or earnings are\\nused frequently to derive a value for venture capital investments.\\n ']",
