The significance level is the probability of making a type I error. Decreasing the probability level makes it more difficult to reject the null when it is true, which means the probability of making a type I error decreases. All else equal, the decrease in the probability of making a type I error comes at the cost of increasing the probability of making a type II error.",

Choices B, C, and D describe situations that can produce inaccurate descriptions of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Multicollinearity occurs when the independent variables are themselves correlated. Heteroscedasticity occurs when the variances are different across observations, and autocorrelation occurs when successive observations are influenced by the preceding observations. 分层与回归分析无关。选项B, C和D描述了可能对自变量和因变量之间的关系产生不准确描述的情况。 当自变量自身相关时，会发生多重共线性。 当不同观测之间的方差不同，异方差性就会发生。 当后续观测值受到前述观测值的影响时会发生自相关。",
