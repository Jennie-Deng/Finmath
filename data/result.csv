their projected profits and cash flows. If consumers are more interested in hedging than
producers are, the futures price will exceed the spot price.In contrast, the insurance theory
predicts that the futures price has to be lower than the current spot price as a form of
payment or remuneration to the speculator who takes on the price risk and provides price
insurance to the commodity seller. Similarly, the theory of storage also predicts that when a

NWC's strategy uses a fixed-weighting scheme to\nallocate exposure among 12 commodities, and it is benchmarked against the\nThomson/Reuters/CoreCommodity CRB Index (TR/CC CRB). Nabli manages the energy and livestock\nsectors with the help of Sota Yamata, a junior analyst.Nabli and Yamata meet to discuss a\nvariety of factors that affect commodity values in the two sectors they manage. Yamata tells\nNabli the following:Statement 1 Storage costs are negatively related to futures\nprices.Statement 2 In contrast to stocks and bonds, most commodity investments are made by\nusing derivatives.Statement 3 Commodities generate future cash flows beyond what can be\nrealized through their purchase and sale.Nabli and Yamata then discuss potential new\ninvestments in the energy sector. They review Brent crude oil futures data, which are presented\nin Exhibit 1.\nYamata presents his research related to the energy sector, which has the following\nconclusions:■ Consumers have been more concerned about prices than producers have.■ Energy is\nconsumed on a real-time basis and requires minimal storage.After concluding the discussion of\nthe energy sector, Nabli reviews the performance of NWC's long position in lean hog futures\ncontracts. Nabli notes that the portfolio earned a –12% price return on the lean hog futures\nposition last year and a –24% roll return after the contracts were rolled forward. The\nposition was held with collateral equal to 100% of the position at a risk-free rate of 1.2% per\nyear.Yamata asks Nabli to clarify how the state of the futures market affects roll returns.\nNabli responds as follows:Statement 4 Roll returns are generally negative when a futures market\nis in contango.Statement 5 Roll returns are generally positive when a futures market is in\nbackwardation.As part of their expansion into new markets, NWC is considering changing its\nbenchmark index. Nabli investigates two indexes as a possible replacement. These indexes both\nuse similar weighting and rebalancing schemes. Index A includes con-tracts of commodities\ntypically in contango, whereas Index B includes contracts of commodities typically in\nbackwardation.

Brady is considering an allocation of the pension system’s assets to private equity.\nShe has asked two of her analysts, Jennifer Chau, CFA, and Matthew Hermansky, to provide more\ninformation about the workings of the private equity market.\nBrady recognizes that the private equity asset class covers a broad spectrum of equity\ninvestments that are not traded in public markets. She asks Chau to describe the major\ndifferences between assets within this asset class. Chau notes that private equity ranges from\nventure capital financing of early-stage companies to complete buyouts of large publicly traded\nor even privately held companies. Chau describes some of the characteristics of venture capital\nand buyout investments.\nChau mentions that private equity firms take care to align the economic interests of the\nmanagers of the investments they control with their own. Various contractual clauses are\ninserted in the compensation contracts of the management team in order to reward or punish\nmanagers who meet or do not meet agreed-upon target objectives.\nOne concern Chau highlights is the illiquidity of private equity investments over time. Some\nfunds are returned to investors, however, over the life of the fund because a number of\ninvestment opportunities are exited early. Provisions in a fund’s prospectus describe the\ndistribution of returns to investors, some of which favor the limited partners. One such\nprovision is the distribution waterfall mechanism that provides distributions to limited\npartners (LPs) before the general partner (GP) receives the carried interest. This distribution\nmechanism is called the total return waterfall.\nChau prepares the following data to illustrate the distribution waterfall mechanism and the\nfunds provided to limited partners when a private equity fund with a zero hurdle rate exits\nfrom its first three projects during a three-year period.\nChau cautions that investors must understand the terminology used to describe the performance\nof private equity funds. Interpretation of performance numbers should be made with the\nawareness that much of the fund assets are illiquid during a substantial part of the fund’s\nlife. She provides the latest data in Exhibit 2 for the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Funds,\ndiversified high-technology venture capital funds formed five years ago, each with five years\nremaining to termination.\nChau studies the data and comments, Of the three funds, the Alpha Fund has the best chance to\noutperform over the remaining life. First, it’s because the management has earned such a\nrelatively high residual value on capital and will be able to earn a high return on the\nremaining funds called down. At termination, the RVPI will be double the 0.65 value when the\nrest of the funds are called down. Second, its cash-on-cash return as measured by DPI is\nalready as high as that of the Beta Fund. The PIC (or paid-in capital) ratio indicates the\nproportion of capital already called by the GP. The PIC of Alpha is relatively low relative to\nBeta and Gamma.\nHermansky notes that a private equity fund’s ability to properly plan and execute its exit\nfrom an investment is vital for the fund’s success. Venture funds, such as Alpha, Beta, and\nGamma, take special care to plan their exits.\nBrady then asks the analysts what procedures private equity firms would use to value\ninvestments in their portfolios as well as investments that are added later. She is concerned\nabout buying into a fund with existing assets that do not have public market prices that can be\nused to ascertain value. In such cases, she worries, what if a GP overvalues the assets and new\ninvestors in the fund pay more for the fund assets than they are worth?\nHermansky makes three statements regarding the valuation methods used in private equity\ntransactions during the early stages of selling a fund to investors.\nStatement 1: For venture capital investment in the early stages of analysis, emphasis is placed\non the discounted cash flow approach to valuation.\nStatement 2: For buyout investments, income-based approaches are used frequently as a primary\nmethod of valuation.\nStatement 3: If a comparable group of companies exist, multiples of revenues or earnings are\nused frequently to derive a value for venture capital investments.\n ']","['/Volumes/Jennie/Reasoning/FinMath/data/CFALevel2/AlternativeInvestments/AlternativeInvestments_images/share47-52_1.png', '/Volumes/Jennie/Reasoning/FinMath/data/CFALevel2/AlternativeInvestments/AlternativeInvestments_images/share47-52_2.png']",[],"[<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGBA size=351x256 at 0x113EBE230>, <PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGBA size=419x154 at 0x113EBD840>]"
