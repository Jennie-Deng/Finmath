Viewing the portfolio as a binomial distributed random variable, there are only two\npossible outcomes for a portfolio acting as one credit. The portfolio has a 2% probability of\ntotal loss and a 98% probability of zero loss. Therefore, with a recovery rate of zero, the\nextreme loss given default is $1,000,000. The expected loss is equal to the portfolio value\ntimes π and is $20,000 in this example. The credit VaR is defined as the quantile of the\ncredit loss less the expected loss of the portfolio. At the 99% confidence level, the credit\nVaR is equal to $980,000.当相关性为1时，整体的投资组合就相当于是一个资产，要不违约，要不就不违\n约。违约概率是2%时，99%的置信水平，对应的预期损失是20,000 ，极端损失是1000000，VaR值是$980,000."

Note that in spite of the fact that we are dealing with a nonconventional cash flow pattern, the IRR has a unique solution. The NPV profile declines as the required rate of return increases, and the NPV value crosses the x-axis (required rate of return) only one time, at 21.4 percent."

      "Question Text: Suppose the five-year fixed-rate borrowing costs to General Electric (GE) and Qantas Airways (QA) in U.S. dollars (USD) and Australian dollars (AUD) are given as shown in the table below: Although GE has a comparative advantage in the USD market, QA has a comparative advantage in the AUD market. However, GE wants (or is willing) to borrow Australian dollars and QA wants (or is willing) to borrow US dollars. The AUDUSD exchange rate is AUDUSD $0.80 (ie, $0.80 USD  per 1.0 AUD) and both want to borrow AUD 20.0 million. The currency swap's financial intermediary will charge 20 basis points (0.20%) and can hedge its currency risk (put another way, the financial intermediary is willing to assume the currency risk). If GE and QA want to share equally the gains enabled by the swap, which of the following currency swap BEST achieves this ?\n",

The FI receives a net USD amount of $240,000=(5.50%-4.0%)×$16.0 million; and the FI pays a net amount of AUD 260,000=(7.0%- 5.70%)×20.0 million. The value of the AUD 260,000 is USD $210,00, such that the FI collects $240,000-$210,000=$30,000 which is 0.0020×$16.0 million. In regard to false (B), this swap improves GE and QA each by 50 basis points but leaves nothing for the FIGE支付AUD 5.70%， QA支付USD 5.50%。FI收到的净美元金额为$240,000=(5.50% - 4.0%)×$16 million;而FI支付的净金额为AUD260,000=(7.0%－5.70%)×20million。26万澳元的价值为21万美元（近似值），因此FI获得24万- 21万= 3万美元，即0.0020×1600万美元。关于B，这个互换提高了GE和QA各50个基点，但没有给FI留下任何东西"

      "Question Text: John is forecasting a stock’s performance in 2010 conditional on the state of the economy of the country in which the firm is based. He divides the economy’s performance into three categories of “GOOD,” “NEUTRAL” and “POOR” and the stock’s performance into three categories of “increase,” “constant” and “decrease.” He estimates: The probability that the state of the economy is GOOD is 20%. If the state of the economy is GOOD, the probability that the stock price increases is 80% and the probability that the stock price decreases is 10%. The probability that the state of the economy is NEUTRAL is 30%. If the state of the economy is NEUTRAL, the probability that the stock price increases is 50% and the probability that the stock price decreases is 30%. If the state of the economy is POOR, the probability that the stock price increases is 15% and the probability that the stock price decreases is 70%. Billy, his supervisor, asks him to estimate the probability that the state of the economy is NEUTRAL given that the stock performance is constant.

      "Question Text: A new equity fund called Machine Trade Bet is managed by an artificially intelligent bot who utilizes machine learning. The fund claims that its true (population) volatility does not exceed 15.0% per annum. However, based on a random sample of 40 observations, a sample volatility of 17.0% per annum is calculated. The desired confidence level is 95.0%; further, this is a one-sided test as the null hypothesis assumes the volatility is equal to, or less than, 15.0% per annum. Should the null hypothesis be rejected, in favor of the alternative hypothesis which asserts that the fund’s true volatility exceeds 15.0%?\n",

Mathematically, the\ndomestic-currency return is expressed as: RDC = (1 + RFC)(1 + RFX) – 1where RDC is the\ndomestic-currency return (in percent), RFC is the foreign-currency return, and RFX is the\npercentage change of the foreign currency against the domestic currency. Note that this RFX\nexpression is calculated using the investor’s domestic currency (the EUR in this case) as the\nprice currency in the P/B quote. This is different than the market-standard currency quotes in\nExhibit 1, where the EUR is the base currency in each of these quotes. Therefore, for the\nforeign currency (USD, GBP, or CHF) to appreciate against the EUR, the market-standard quote\n(USD/EUR, GBP/EUR, or CHF/EUR, respectively) must decrease; i.e. the EUR must depreciate.The\nEuro-Swiss (CHF/EUR) is the only spot rate with a negative change (from 1.2175 to 1.2080),\nmeaning the EUR depreciated against the CHF (the CHF/EUR rate decreased). Or put differently,\nthe CHF appreciated against the EUR, adding to the EUR-denominated return for the German\ninvestor holding CHF-denominated assets. This would result in a higher domestic-currency return\n(RDC), for the German investor, relative to the foreign-currency return (RFC) for the CHF-\ndenominated assets. Both the Euro-dollar (USD/EUR) and Euro-sterling (GBP/EUR) experienced a\npositive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against these two currencies (the\nUSD/EUR rate and the GBP/EUR rate both increased). This would result in a lower domestic-\ncurrency return (RDC) for the German investor relative to the foreign-currency return (RFC) for\nthe USD- and GBP-denominated assets.A is incorrect because the Euro-dollar (USD/EUR)\nexperienced a positive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against the USD\n(the USD/EUR rate increased). This would result in a lower domestic-currency (i.e. EUR-\ndenominated) return relative to the foreign-currency return for the USD-denominated assets,\nsince the USD has depreciated against the EUR.B is incorrect because the Euro-sterling\n(GBP/EUR) experienced a positive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against\nthe GPB (the GBP/EUR rate increased). This would result in a lower domestic-currency (i.e. EUR-\ndenominated) return relative to the foreign-currency return for the GBP-denominated assets,\nsince the GBP has depreciated against the EUR."

(The bid of 0.23980 is the inverse of the BRL/USD offer, calculated\nas 1/4.1702; the offer of 0.23982 is the inverse of the BRL/USD bid, calculated as 1/4.1698.)\nMultiplying the CHF/USD and USD/BRL bid–offer rates then leads to the interbank implied\nCHF/BRL cross rate:\nBid: 0.9799 × 0.23980 = 0.2349\nOffer: 0.9801 × 0.23982 = 0.23505\nSince the dealer is willing to buy BRL at 0.2355 but BRL can be purchased from the interbank\nmarket at 0.23505, there is an arbitrage opportunity to buy BRL in the interbank market and\nsell BRL to the dealer for a profit of 0.0045 CHF (0.2355 – 0.23505) per BRL transacted."

      "text/markdown": "Explanation: The carry trade involves borrowing in a lower-yielding currency to invest in a\nhigher-yielding\none and netting any profit after allowing for borrowing costs and exchange rate movements. The\nrelevant trade is to borrow USD and lend in euros. To calculate the all-in USD return from a\none-year EUR Libor deposit, first determine the current and one-year-later USD/EUR exchange\nrates. Because one USD buys CAD 1.3200 today and one CAD buys EUR 0.6506 today, today’s\nEUR/USD rate is the product of these two numbers: 1.3200 × 0.6506 = 0.8588. The projected rate\none year later is 1.3151 × 0.6567 = 0.8636. Accordingly, measured in dollars, the investment\nreturn for the unhedged EUR Libor deposit is equal to\n(1.3200 × 0.6506) × (1＋0.022) × [1/(1.3151 × 0.6567)] –1\n= 0.8588 × (1.022) × (1/0.8636) –1 = 1.01632 – 1 = 1.632%\nHowever, the borrowing costs must be charged against this gross return to fund the carry trade\ninvestment (one-year USD Libor was 0.80%). The net return on the carry trade is therefore\n1.632% – 0.80% = 0.832%."

Because of leverage, the return is 50% = 2.5 ×\n20%.Another way to look at this problem is that the equity contributed by the trader (the\nminimum margin requirement) is 40% = 100% ÷ 2.5. The trader contributed $20 = 40% of $50 per\nshare. The gain is $10 per share, resulting in a return of 50% = 10/20. ： C是正确的。回报率是\n50%。 如果该头寸无杠杆，回报率将为20%=（60-50）/50。由于杠杆作用，收益率被放大为50%=2.5*20%。"

Since we are told that there are only five tail slices, there will be four (i.e., n-1) VaR quantiles. Therefore, $S = [(3.25 + 3.6 + 4.00 + 4.75) / (5-1)] = 3.90$. Note that the tail VaR at 95% is not included in the calculation since ES is the average loss beyond 5% VaR. In addition, as the number of tail slices increases, the average ES will increase as the number of higher confidence tail VaRs increases."

The mean absolute deviation (MAD) of Fund ABC’s returns is greater\nthan the MAD of both of the other funds.\nThe numbers shown for variance are understood to be in “percent squared” terms so that when\ntaking the square root, the result is standard deviation in percentage terms. Alternatively, by\nexpressing standard deviation and variance in decimal form, one can avoid the issue of units;\nin decimal form, the variances for Fund ABC, Fund XYZ, and Fund PQR are 0.0317, 0.0243, and\n0.0110, respectively.\nC正确。 ABC基金回报的平均绝对偏差(MAD)大于其他两个基金的MAD。 ABC基金的MAD = [|-20-(-4)|＋|23-\n(-4)|＋|-14-(-4)|＋|5-(-4)|＋|-14-(-4)|]/5=14.4% XYZ基金的MAD =[|-33-(-10.8)|＋|-12-(-\n10.8)|＋|-12-(-10.8)|＋|-8-(-10.8)|＋|11-(-10.8)|]/5=9.8% PQR基金的MAD=[|-14-(-5)|＋|-18-(-\n5)|＋|6-(-5)|＋|-2-(-5)|＋|3-(-5)|]/5=8.8% A和B错误: 方差的数字被理解为“百分比的平方”的形式\n，所以当取平方根时，结果就是百分比的标准偏差。或者，用小数表示标准差和方差，就可以避免单位的问\n题;以小数形式表示，基金ABC、基金XYZ和基金PQR的方差分别为0.0317、0.0243和0.0110。"

Third, recognizethat on the left-hand side we have a standard normal\nvariable, denoted by Z and N(–x) = 1 – N(x).

B正确。 有三个步骤，涉及到标准化投资组合收益:首先，从不等式的每一边\n减去投资组合平均收益:P(投资组合收益- 7%)≤4% - 7%)。其次，等式两边同时除以投资组合收益的标准差\n:P[(投资组合收益- 7%)/13%≤(4% - 7%)/13%]= P(Z≤- 0.2308)= N(- 0.2308)。第三，在左边我们有一个\n标准正太分布的变量，用Z和N(- x) = 1 - N(x)表示。在使用累积分布函数(cdf)表时，N(- 0.23) = 1 -\nN(0.23) = 1 - 0.5910 = 0.409，约占41%。投资组合表现不佳的可能性约为41%。"

Using the TI BA II calculator: 20 N, 3 I/Y, 4.5 PMT, 100 FV and CPT PV = -122.3162, then we only need to change the periods with 18 N, CPT I/Y [display: I/Y = 2.8922] × 2 = 5.7843%.当Sally最初购买债券时，其价格等于=-PV(0.060/2, 10×2, $100×0.090/2, 100) = $122.3162。如果价格没有变化，则一年后（即N – 2期），收益率将以RATE（9×2，$ 100×0.090 / 2，-122.3162，100）×2 = 5.7843％。使用TI BA II 计算器：20 N，3 I / Y，4.5 PMT，100 FV和CPT PV = -122.3162，那么我们只需要将周期更改为18 N，CPT I / Y [显示：I / Y = 2.8922]×2 = 5.7843％。"

In order to replicate the cash flows of the 8% bond, you could solve a system of equations to determine the weight factors, F1 and F2, which correspond to the proportion of the zero and the 10% bond to be held, respectively. The two equations are as follows: (100 × F1) + (105 × F2) = 104 (replicating the cash flow including principal and interest payments at the end of 1 year), and (5 × F2) = 4 (replicating the cash flow from the coupon payment in 6 months). Solving the two equations gives us F1 = 0.2 and F2 = 0.8. Thus the price of the 8% bond should be 0.2 (96.12) + 0.8 (106.2) = 104.18."

      "text/markdown": "Explanation: B is correct. Under the revised Standardized Measurement Approach, operational risk\ncapital is equal to the Business Indicator Component multiplied by the Internal Loss\nMultiplier.The Business Indicator Component is determined by the Business Indicator (BI), which\nis made up of almost the same P&L items that are found in the composition of Gross Income (GI).\nThe main difference relates to how the items are combined. The BI uses positive values of its\ncomponents, thereby avoiding counterintuitive negative contributions from some of the bank’s\nbusinesses to the capital charge (e.g. negative P&L on the trading book), which is possible\nunder the GI. In addition, the BI includes income statement items related to activities that\nproduce operational risk that are omitted (e.g. P&L on the banking book) or netted (e.g. fee\nexpenses, other operating expenses) in the GI.In this case, the BI is already given as EUR\n1,200 million.Therefore, with a BI of EUR 1,200 million falling into the BI range of Bucket 2,\nand given that the Internal Loss Multiplier is equal to 1, the calculation of the operational\nrisk capital for the bank in Bucket 2 is calculated as follows:SMA operational risk capital\n(Bucket 2) = BIC×1 = EUR 120 million + 0.15(BI – EUR 1 billion) = EUR 120 million + 0.15(EUR\n1,200 million – EUR 1,000 million) = EUR 150 million.BI=EUR 1,200 millionSMA下操作风险资本金\n(Bucket 2) = BIC×1 = EUR 120 million＋0.15(BI – EUR 1 billion) = EUR 120 million＋  \n0.15(EUR 1,200 million – EUR 1,000 million) = EUR 150 million"
