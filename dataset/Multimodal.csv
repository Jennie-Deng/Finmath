0,1,"Neshie Wakuluk is an investment strategist who develops capital market expectations for
an investment firm that invests across asset classes and global markets. Wakuluk started her
career when the global markets were experiencing significant volatility and poor returns; as a
result, she is now careful to base her conclusions on objective evidence and analytical
procedures to mitigate any potential biases.Wakuluk’s approach to economic forecasting
utilizes a structural model in conjunction with a diffusion index to determine the current
phase of a country’s business cycle. This approach has produced successful predictions in the
past, thus Wakuluk has high confidence in the predictions. Wakuluk also determines whether any
adjustments need to be made to her initial estimates of the respective aggregate economic
growth trends based on historical rates of growth for Countries X and Y (both developed
markets) and Country Z (a developing market). Exhibit 1 summarizes Wakuluk’s predictions:
Wakuluk assumes short-term interest rates adjust with expected inflation and are procyclical.
Wakuluk reviews the historical short-term interest rate trends for each country, which further
confirms her predictions shown in Exhibit 1.Wakuluk decides to focus on Country Y to determine
the path of nominal interest rates, the potential economic response of Country Y’s economy to
this path, and the timing for when Country Y’s economy may move into the next business cycle.
Wakuluk makes the following observations:Observation 1 Monetary policy has been persistently
loose for Country Y, while fiscal policies have been persistently tight.Observation 2 Country Y
is expected to significantly increase transfer payments and introduce a more progressive tax
regime.Observation 3 The current yield curve for Country Y suggests that the business cycle is
in the slowdown phase, with bond yields starting to reflect contractionary conditions.

It accelerates in the later stages of the business cycle when the output gap has closed, and it
decelerates when a large output gap puts downward pressure on wages and prices, which often
happens during a recession or the early years afterward. As long as short-term interest rates
adjust with expected inflation, cash is essentially a zero-duration, inflation-protected asset
that earns a floating real rate, which is typically procyclical. Wakuluk assumes short-term
interest rates adjust with expected inflation and are procyclical. Thus, short-term rates are

to discuss investment opportunities for the Fund. Chan notes that SGS adheres to ISDA
(International Swaps and Derivatives Association) protocols for credit default swap (CDS)
transactions and that any contract must conform to ISDA specifications. Before the Fund can
engage in trading CDS products with SGS, the Fund must satisfy compliance requirements.
Smith explains to Chan that fixed-income derivatives strategies are being contemplated for both
hedging and trading purposes. Given the size and diversified nature of the Fund, Smith asks
Chan to recommend a type of CDS that would allow the Fund to simultaneously fully hedge
multiple fixed-income exposures.
Smith and Chan discuss opportunities to add trading profits to the Fund. Smith asks Chan to
determine the probability of default associated with a five-year investment-grade bond issued
by Orion Industrial. Selected data on the Orion Industrial bond are presented in Exhibit 1.
Chan explains that a single-name CDS can also be used to add profit to the Fund over time. Chan
describes a hypothetical trade in which the Fund sells ￡6 million of five-year CDS protection
on Orion, where the CDS contract has a duration of 3.9 years. Chan assumes that the Fund closes
the position six months later, after Orion’s credit spread narrowed from 150 bps to 100 bps.
Chan discusses the mechanics of a long/short trade. In order to structure a number of potential
trades, Chan and Smith exchange their respective views on individual companies and global
economies. Chan and Smith agree on the following outlooks.
Outlook 1: The European economy will weaken.
Outlook 2: The US economy will strengthen relative to that of Canada.
Outlook 3: The credit quality of electric car manufacturers will improve relative to that of
traditional car manufacturers.
Chan believes US macroeconomic data are improving and that the general economy will strengthen
in the short term. Chan suggests that a curve trade could be used by the Fund to capitalize on
her short-term view of a steepening of the US credit curve.
Another short-term trading opportunity that Smith and Chan discuss involves the merger and
acquisition market. SGS believes that Delta Corporation may make an unsolicited bid at a
premium to the market price for all of the publicly traded shares of Zega, Inc. Zega’s market
capitalization and capital structure are comparable to Delta’s; both firms are highly levered.

determine the probability of default associated with a five-year investment-grade bond issued
by Orion Industrial. Selected data on the Orion Industrial bond are presented in Exhibit 1.
Chan explains that a single-name CDS can also be used to add profit to the Fund over time. Chan
describes a hypothetical trade in which the Fund sells ￡6 million of five-year CDS protection
on Orion, where the CDS contract has a duration of 3.9 years. Chan assumes that the Fund closes
the position six months later, after Orion’s credit spread narrowed from 150 bps to 100 bps.
Chan discusses the mechanics of a long/short trade. In order to structure a number of potential
trades, Chan and Smith exchange their respective views on individual companies and global
economies. Chan and Smith agree on the following outlooks.
Outlook 1: The European economy will weaken.
Outlook 2: The US economy will strengthen relative to that of Canada.
Outlook 3: The credit quality of electric car manufacturers will improve relative to that of
traditional car manufacturers.
Chan believes US macroeconomic data are improving and that the general economy will strengthen
in the short term. Chan suggests that a curve trade could be used by the Fund to capitalize on
her short-term view of a steepening of the US credit curve.
Another short-term trading opportunity that Smith and Chan discuss involves the merger and
acquisition market. SGS believes that Delta Corporation may make an unsolicited bid at a
premium to the market price for all of the publicly traded shares of Zega, Inc. Zega’s market
capitalization and capital structure are comparable to Delta’s; both firms are highly levered.
It is anticipated that Delta will issue new equity along with 5- and 10-year senior unsecured
debt to fund the acquisition, which will significantly increase its debt ratio.
 ",['./dataset/images/FixedIncome_images/share10-17_1.png'],A profitable equity-versus-credit trade involving Delta and Zega is to:,,"{'A': 'short Zega shares and buy protection on Delta using the 10-year CDS.', './dataset/images/B': 'go long Zega shares and buy protection on Delta using 5-year CDS.', './dataset/images/C': 'go long Delta shares and buy protection on Delta using 5-year CDS.'}",B,"The shares of Zega can be sold at a higher price as a result of the unsolicited bid
in the market. If Delta Corporation issues significantly more debt, there is a higher
probability that it may default. If the Fund sells protection on Delta now, the trade will
realize a profit as credit spreads widen. An equity-versus-credit trade would be to go long
(buy) the Zega shares and buy protection on Delta.",Knowledge reasoning QA,text+image,Easy,"Credit Default Swaps (CDS), Equity Investments, Credit Risk",Fixed Income,FixedIncome

decelerates when a large output gap puts downward pressure on wages and prices, which often
happens during a recession or the early years afterward. As long as short-term interest rates

1131,1,"Megan Beade and Hanna Müller are senior analysts for a large, multi-divisional money
management firm. Beade supports the institutional portfolio managers, and Müller does the same
for the private wealth portfolio managers.Beade reviews the asset allocation in Exhibit 1,
derived from a mean–variance optimization (MVO) model for an institutional client, noting that
details of the MVO are lacking.
The firm’s policy is to rebalance a portfolio when the asset class weight falls outside of a
corridor around the target allocation. The width of each corridor is customized for each client
and proportional to the target allocation. Beade recommends wider corridor widths for high-risk
asset classes, narrower corridor widths for less liquid asset classes, and narrower corridor
widths for taxable clients with high capital gains tax rates.One client sponsors a defined
benefit pension plan where the present value of the liabilities is $241 million and the market
value of plan assets is $205 million. Beade expects interest rates to rise and both the present
value of plan liabilities and the market value of plan assets to decrease by $25 million,
changing the pension plan’s funding ratio.Beade uses a surplus optimization approach to
liability-relative asset allocation based on the objective functionU_m^LR=E(Rs,m) -
0.005λσ2(Rs,m)where E(Rs,m) is the expected surplus return for portfolio m, λ is the risk
aversion coefficient, and σ2(Rs,m) is the variance of the surplus return. Beade establishes
the expected surplus return and surplus variance for three different asset allocations, shown
in Exhibit 2. Given λ = 1.50, she chooses the optimal asset mix.
Client Haunani Kealoha has a large fixed obligation due in 10 years. Beade assesses that
Kealoha has substantially more funds than are required to meet the fixed obligation. The client
wants to earn a competitive risk-adjusted rate of return while maintaining a high level of
certainty that there will be sufficient assets to meet the fixed obligation.In the private
wealth area, the firm has designed five subportfolios with differing asset allocations that are
used to fund different client goals over a five-year horizon. Exhibit 3 shows the expected
returns and volatilities of the subportfolios and the probabilities that the subportfolios will
exceed an expected minimum return. Client Luis Rodríguez wants to satisfy two goals. Goal 1
requires a conservative portfolio providing the highest possible minimum return that will be
met at least 95% of the time. Goal 2 requires a riskier portfolio that provides the highest
minimum return that will be exceeded at least 85% of the time.
Müller uses a risk parity asset allocation approach with a client’s four–asset class
portfolio. The expected return of the domestic bond asset class is the lowest of the asset
classes, and the returns of the domestic bond asset class have the lowest covariance with other
asset class returns. Müller estimates the weight that should be placed on domestic bonds.Müller
and a client discuss other approaches to asset allocation that are not based on optimization
models or goals-based models. Müller makes the following comments to the client:
Comment 1：An advantage of the “120 minus your age” heuristic over the 60/40 stock/bond
heuristic is that it incorporates an age-based stock/bond allocation.
Comment 2:The Yale model emphasizes traditional investments and a commitment to active
management.
Comment 3:A client’s asset allocation using the 1/N rule depends on the investment
characteristics of each asset class.

used to fund different client goals over a five-year horizon. Exhibit 3 shows the expected
returns and volatilities of the subportfolios and the probabilities that the subportfolios will
exceed an expected minimum return. Client Luis Rodríguez wants to satisfy two goals. Goal 1
requires a conservative portfolio providing the highest possible minimum return that will be

minimum return that will be exceeded at least 85% of the time.
Müller uses a risk parity asset allocation approach with a client’s four–asset class
portfolio. The expected return of the domestic bond asset class is the lowest of the asset
classes, and the returns of the domestic bond asset class have the lowest covariance with other
asset class returns. Müller estimates the weight that should be placed on domestic bonds.Müller
and a client discuss other approaches to asset allocation that are not based on optimization
models or goals-based models. Müller makes the following comments to the client:
Comment 1：An advantage of the “120 minus your age” heuristic over the 60/40 stock/bond
heuristic is that it incorporates an age-based stock/bond allocation.
Comment 2:The Yale model emphasizes traditional investments and a commitment to active
management.
Comment 3:A client’s asset allocation using the 1/N rule depends on the investment
characteristics of each asset class.

management firm. Beade supports the institutional portfolio managers, and Müller does the same
for the private wealth portfolio managers.Beade reviews the asset allocation in Exhibit 1,
derived from a mean–variance optimization (MVO) model for an institutional client, noting that
details of the MVO are lacking.
The firm’s policy is to rebalance a portfolio when the asset class weight falls outside of a
corridor around the target allocation. The width of each corridor is customized for each client
and proportional to the target allocation. Beade recommends wider corridor widths for high-risk
asset classes, narrower corridor widths for less liquid asset classes, and narrower corridor
widths for taxable clients with high capital gains tax rates.One client sponsors a defined
benefit pension plan where the present value of the liabilities is $241 million and the market
value of plan assets is $205 million. Beade expects interest rates to rise and both the present
value of plan liabilities and the market value of plan assets to decrease by $25 million,
changing the pension plan’s funding ratio.Beade uses a surplus optimization approach to

portfolio manager Mordechai Garcia. Aycrig Fund invests money for high-net-worth and
institutional investors. Chen asks Garcia to analyze certain information relating to Aycrig
Fund's three sub-managers, Managers A, B, and C.Manager A has $250 million in assets under
management (AUM), an active risk of 5%, an information coefficient of 0.15, and a transfer
coefficient of 0.40. Manager A's portfolio has a 2.5% expected active return this year.Chen
directs Garcia to determine the maximum position size that Manager A can hold in shares of
Pasliant Corporation, which has a market capitalization of $3.0 billion, an index weight of
0.20%, and an average daily trading volume (ADV) of 1% of its market capitalization.Manager A
has the following position size policy constraints:
■Allocation: No investment in any security may represent more than 3% of total AUM.
■Liquidity: No position size may represent more than 10% of the dollar value of the security's
ADV.
■Index weight: The maximum position weight must be less than or equal to 10 times the
security's weight in the index.Manager B holds a highly diversified portfolio that has balanced
exposures to rewarded risk factors, high active share, and a relatively low active risk
target.Selected data on Manager C's portfolio, which contains three assets, is presented in
Exhibit 1.
Chen considers adding a fourth sub-manager and evaluates three managers' portfolios, Portfolios
X, Y, and Z. The managers for Portfolios X, Y, and Z all have similar costs, fees, and alpha
skills, and their factor exposures align with both Aycrig's and investors' expectations and
constraints. The portfolio factor exposures, risk contributions, and risk characteristics are
presented in Exhibits 2 and 3.
 
Chen and Garcia next discuss characteristics of long–short and long-only investing. Garcia
makes the following statements about investing with long–short and long-only managers:
Statement 1: A long–short portfolio allows for a gross exposure of 100%.
Statement 2: A long-only portfolio generally allows for greater investment capacity than other
approaches, particularly when using strategies that focus on large-cap stocks.
Chen and Garcia then turn their attention to portfolio management approaches. Chen prefers an

funds:
Note 1: The fee on the Caribou Fund is a 15% share of any capital appreciation above a 7%
threshold and the use of a high-water mark.
Note 2: The DoGood Fund invests in Fleeker Corporation stock, which is rated high in the ESG
space, and Fleeker’s pension fund has a significant investment in the DoGood Fund. This
dynamic has the potential for a conflict of interest on the part of Fleeker Corporation but not
for the DoGood Fund.
Note 3: The DoGood Fund’s portfolio manager has written policies stating that the fund does
not engage in shareholder activism. Therefore, the DoGood Fund may be a free-rider on the
activism by these shareholders.

minimize fees and believe that the market is efficient.
Note 5: Adding investment-grade bonds to the Elmer Fund will decrease the portfolio’s short-

Smith discusses means of enhancing income for the three funds with the junior analyst, Kolton
Frey, including engaging in securities lending or writing covered calls. Frey tells Smith the
following:
Statement 1: Securities lending would increase income through reinvestment of the cash
collateral but would require the fund to miss out on dividend income from the lent securities.
Statement 2: Writing covered calls would generate income, but doing so would limit the upside
share price appreciation for the underlying shares.

production and transportation industries in many countries. The fund’s description is

growth. In addition, style is often determined through a “scoring” system that incorporates
multiple metrics or ratios, such as price-to-book ratios, price-to-earnings ratios, earnings
growth, dividend yield, and book value growth. These metrics are then typically “scored”
individually for each company, assigned certain weights, and then aggregated.B is incorrect

interest rate swap with annual resets using the present value factors presented in Exhibit 1.
Johnson also uses the present value factors in Exhibit 1 to value an interest rate swap that
the bank entered into one year ago as the pay-fixed (receive-floating) party. Selected data for
the swap are presented in Exhibit 2. Johnson notes that the current equilibrium two-year fixed

One of the bank's investments is exposed to movements in the Japanese yen, and Johnson desires
to hedge the currency exposure. She prices a one-year fixed-for-fixed currency swap involving
yen and US dollars, with a quarterly reset. Johnson uses the interest rate data presented in
Exhibit 3 to price the currency swap.
Johnson next reviews an equity swap with an annual reset that the bank entered into six months

the bank should enter into new positions in 1 × 4 and 2 × 5 FRAs.
 
Three months later, the 6 × 9 FRA in Exhibit 6 reaches expiration, at which time the three-
month US dollar Libor is 1.10% and the six-month US dollar Libor is 1.20%. Johnson determines

$$

The 6 $\times$ 9 FRA expires six months after initiation. The bank entered into the FRA 90 days ago; thus, the FRA will expire in 90 days. To value the FRA, the first step is to compute the new FRA rate, which is the rate on Day 90 of an FRA that expires in 90 days in which the underlying is the 90-day Libor, or FRA (90,90,90):

$$
FRA(g,h-g,m) = \left\{[1+L_g(h-g + m)t_{h-g+m}]-1\right\} / t_m
$$

$$
FRA(90,90,90) = \{ [1+L_{90}(180-90+90)(180/360)]-1\} /(90/360)
$$

$$
= \{ [1+L_{90}(180-90)(90/360)]-1\} /(90/360)
$$

$$
FRA(90,90,90) = \left\{[1+L_{90}(180/360)]/[1+L_{90}(90)(90/360)]-1\right\}/(90/360)
$$

Exhibit 7 indicates that L90 (180) = 0.95% and L90 (90) = 0.90%, so

$$
FRA (90, 90, 90) = 
$$ 
$$
([1 + 0.0095(180/360) / [1 + 0.0090(90/360)] - 1) / (90/360)

$$
FRA (90, 90, 90) = ([(1.00475/1.00225) - 1] (4) = 0.0025 or 0.9978
$$

Therefore, given the FRA rate at initiation of 0.70% and notional principal of $20 million from Exhibit 1, the current value of the forward contract is calculated as

$$

firm specializing in food retailers. The retail food industry has been consolidating during the
past two years as private equity funds have closed numerous deals and taken many companies
private.Crawfood recently hired Lillian Voser, a CFA Level II candidate, as a controller. On
Voser's first day of work, the head of personnel informs her that by signing the employment
contract, Voser agrees to comply with the company's code of ethics and compliance manual. She
hands Voser copies of the code and compliance manual without further comment. Voser spends the
next hour reading both documents. An excerpt from the compliance manual appears in Exhibit 1.
When she enters her new office that afternoon, Voser finds a large gift basket sent by her
sister. The card reads “Congratulations on your new position.” The basket is filled with
expensive high-quality food items from Greenhornfood—a local small, publicly-traded food
retailer, which produces many delicatessen products under its own brand name.During the next
two weeks, Voser meets with all of Crawfood's upper management, including the CEO. In his
office, Craw praises Voser's efforts to complete the CFA program. “The program is demanding,
but it is worthwhile.” Craw then explains his investment strategy for choosing Crawfood's
acquisition targets. He points to a large map on the wall with multi-colored pins marking
Crawfood's previous takeovers. The map shows acquisitions in all the major cities of Germany
with one exception—the home of Crawfood headquarters. Craw remarks, “We are currently in
talks for another purchase. Confidentiality prohibits me from discussing it any further, but
you will hear more about it soon.”Introduced to Greenhornfood by her sister, Voser quickly
becomes a loyal customer. She considers it the best food retailer in the vicinity and she
frequently purchases its products.The following week, the local newspaper features an article
about Greenhornfood and its young founders. The article describes the company's loyal and
growing customer base as well as its poor quarterly financial results. Voser notes that the
stock has steadily declined during the past twelve months. She concludes that the company has
an inexperienced management team, but its popular product line and loyal customer base make the
company a potential acquisition target. Voser calls her sister and recommends that she purchase
Greenhornfood shares because “it would be an attractive acquisition for a larger company.”
Based on Voser's recommendation, her sister buys €3,000 worth of shares.During the following
two weeks the stock price of Greenhornfood continues to decline. Voser's sister is uncertain of
what she should do with her position. She seeks Voser's advice. Voser recommends that her
sister wait another few days before making her decision and promises to analyze the situation
in the meantime.While walking by Craw's office the following day, Voser sees a document with
Greenhornfood's distinctive logo and overhears the company's name through an open office door.
That evening, Voser tells her sister, “with the price decline, the stock is even more
attractive.” She recommends that her sister increase her position. Based on her recommendation
her sister buys an additional €3,000 worth of Greenhornfood shares.One month later, Crawfood
publicly announces the acquisition of Greenhornfood Company at a 20% premium to the previous
day's closing price. Following the announcement, Voser's sister boasts about Voser's excellent
recommendation and timing to her broker.Regulatory authorities initiate an investigation into
suspicious trading in Greenhornfood shares and options preceding the formal announcement of the
acquisition. Craw receives a letter from regulatory authorities stating that he is the subject
of a formal investigation into his professional conduct surrounding the acquisition. He learns
from the compliance officer that Voser is also under investigation. The compliance officer
provides no details and out of respect for Voser's privacy, Craw makes no inquiries.The
situation remains unchanged and the matter is still pending with regulatory authorities several
months later when Craw receives his annual Professional Conduct Statement (PCS) from CFA
Institute. He reviews the text asking “In the last two years, have you been . . . the subject
of…any investigation…in which your professional conduct, in either a direct or supervisory
capacity, was at issue?”

2719,6,"Hiram Life (Hiram), a large multinational insurer located in Canada, has received
permission to increase its ownership in an India-based life insurance company, LICIA, from 26%
to 49%. Before completing this transaction, Hiram wants to complete a risk assessment of
LICIA's investment portfolio. Judith Hamilton, Hiram's chief financial officer, has been asked
to brief the management committee on investment risk in its India-based insurance
operations.LICIA's portfolio, which has a market value of CAD 260 million, is currently
structured as shown in Exhibit 1. Despite its more than 1,000 individual holdings, the
portfolio is invested predominantly in India. The Indian government bond market is highly
liquid, but the country's mortgage and infrastructure loan markets, as well as the corporate
bond market, are relatively illiquid. Individual mortgage and corporate bond positions are
large relative to the normal trading volumes in these securities. Given the elevated current
and fiscal account deficits, Indian investments are also subject to above-average economic
risk.Hamilton begins with a summary of the India-based portfolio. Exhibit 1 presents the
current portfolio composition and the risk and return assumptions used to esti?mate value at
risk (VaR).
Infrastructure is a rapidly growing asset class with limited return history; the first
infrastructure loans were issued just 10 years ago.Hamilton's report to the management
committee must outline her assumptions and provide support for the methods she used in her risk
assessment. If needed, she will also make recommendations for rebalancing the portfolio to
ensure its risk profile is aligned with that of Hiram.Hamilton develops the assumptions shown
in Exhibit 2, which will be used for estimating the portfolio VaR.
Hamilton elects to apply a one-day, 5% VaR limit of CAD 2 million in her risk assessment of
LICIA,s portfolio. This limit is consistent with the risk tolerance the committee has specified
for the Hiram portfolio.The markets' volatility during the last 12 months has been
significantly higher than the historical norm, with increased frequency of large daily losses,
and Hamilton expects the next 12 months to be equally volatile.She estimates the one-day 5%
portfolio VaR for LICIA's portfolio using three different approaches:
The committee is likely to have questions in a number of key areas—the limitations of the VaR
report, potential losses in an extreme adverse event, and the reliability of the VaR numbers if
the market continues to exhibit higher-than-normal volatility. Hamilton wants to be certain
that she has thoroughly evaluated the risks inherent in the LICIA portfolio and compares them
with the risks in Hiram's present portfolio.Hamilton believes the possibility of a ratings
downgrade on Indian sovereign debt is high and not yet fully reflected in securities prices. If
the rating is lowered, many of the portfolio's holdings will no longer meet Hiram's minimum
ratings requirement. A downgrade's effect is unlikely to be limited to the government bond
portfolio. All asset classes can be expected to be affected to some degree. Hamilton plans to
include a scenario analysis that reflects this possibility to ensure that management has the
broadest possible view of the risk exposures in the India portfolio.
