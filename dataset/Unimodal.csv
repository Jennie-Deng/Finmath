reference rate plus a spread. Different reference rates are used depending on where the bond is
issued and its currency denomination, but one of the most widely used set of reference rates is
Libor. A and C are incorrect because a bond’s spread and frequency of coupon payments are
typically set when the bond is issued and do not change during the bond’s life. ： B是正确的。

解开：该题主要考点为二项分布的性质。
- 设$n$为二项分布实验的次数，由上题可知$n=250$。
- 设$p$为每次实验中失败的概率，由上题可知$p=1\%$。

由二项分布的性质可知均值和标准差分别为：

Mean = $n \times p = 250 \times 1\% = 2.5.$

Standard deviation = $\sqrt{n \times p \times (1-p)} = \sqrt{250 \times 0.01 \times 0.99} = 1.573.$

解答: 该题主要考虑泊松分布的应用。泊松分布概率函数如下：

$$
P(X = K) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

其中表示在时间内事件发生的平均次数。在本题中平均损失超过 $2\text{ million}$ 的次数 $\lambda$，因此在 $2$ 年内的损失超过 $2\text{ million}$ 的平均次数为 $\lambda = 2 \times 3 = 6$。

由于题目要求在接下来的两时间范围内，至少有 $1$ 次损失超过 $2\text{ million}$ 的概率。因此设随机变量 $X$ 的取值为 $1$ 和 $0$，因此根据泊松分布概率函数可以得到：

$$
P(X = 0 \text{ or } 1) = \frac{6^0 e^{-6}}{0!} + \frac{6^1 e^{-6}}{1!} = 6 \times e^{-6} = 0.01735
