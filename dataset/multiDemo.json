Inflation is procyclical.\nIt accelerates in the later stages of the business cycle when the output gap has closed, and it\ndecelerates when a large output gap puts downward pressure on wages and prices, which often\nhappens during a recession or the early years afterward. As long as short-term interest rates\nadjust with expected inflation, cash is essentially a zero-duration, inflation-protected asset\nthat earns a floating real rate, which is typically procyclical. Wakuluk assumes short-term\ninterest rates adjust with expected inflation and are procyclical. Thus, short-term rates are\nmost likely to be low and bottoming if Country X is in the initial recovery phase of the\nbusiness cycle.",

The reason is because a decline in interest rates may\nresult in the call option moving into the money, which limits the price appreciation of the\ncallable bond. Exhibit 1 also shows that the price of the Al bond is 100.200 and that it is\ncallable at par in one year and two years. Thus, the call option is already in the money and\nwould likely be exercised in response to increases in the Al bond's price.",

Exhibit 1 shows that the callable Al bond is currently priced\nslightly higher than its call price of par value, which means the embedded call option is in\nthe money. The put option embedded in the CE bond is not in the money; the bond is currently\npriced 2.1% above par value. Thus, at the current price, the putable CE bond is more likely to\nbehave like the option-free BI bond. Consequently, the effective convexity of the AI bond will\nlikely be lower than the option-free BI bond and the putable CE bond.",

        "Share Context": "John Smith, a fixed-income portfolio manager at a €10 billion sovereign wealth fund\n(the Fund), meets with Sofia Chan, a derivatives strategist with Shire Gate Securities (SGS),\nto discuss investment opportunities for the Fund. Chan notes that SGS adheres to ISDA\n(International Swaps and Derivatives Association) protocols for credit default swap (CDS)\ntransactions and that any contract must conform to ISDA specifications. Before the Fund can\nengage in trading CDS products with SGS, the Fund must satisfy compliance requirements.\nSmith explains to Chan that fixed-income derivatives strategies are being contemplated for both\nhedging and trading purposes. Given the size and diversified nature of the Fund, Smith asks\nChan to recommend a type of CDS that would allow the Fund to simultaneously fully hedge\nmultiple fixed-income exposures.\nSmith and Chan discuss opportunities to add trading profits to the Fund. Smith asks Chan to\ndetermine the probability of default associated with a five-year investment-grade bond issued\nby Orion Industrial. Selected data on the Orion Industrial bond are presented in Exhibit 1.\nChan explains that a single-name CDS can also be used to add profit to the Fund over time. Chan\ndescribes a hypothetical trade in which the Fund sells ￡6 million of five-year CDS protection\non Orion, where the CDS contract has a duration of 3.9 years. Chan assumes that the Fund closes\nthe position six months later, after Orion’s credit spread narrowed from 150 bps to 100 bps.\nChan discusses the mechanics of a long/short trade. In order to structure a number of potential\ntrades, Chan and Smith exchange their respective views on individual companies and global\neconomies. Chan and Smith agree on the following outlooks.\nOutlook 1: The European economy will weaken.\nOutlook 2: The US economy will strengthen relative to that of Canada.\nOutlook 3: The credit quality of electric car manufacturers will improve relative to that of\ntraditional car manufacturers.\nChan believes US macroeconomic data are improving and that the general economy will strengthen\nin the short term. Chan suggests that a curve trade could be used by the Fund to capitalize on\nher short-term view of a steepening of the US credit curve.\nAnother short-term trading opportunity that Smith and Chan discuss involves the merger and\nacquisition market. SGS believes that Delta Corporation may make an unsolicited bid at a\npremium to the market price for all of the publicly traded shares of Zega, Inc. Zega’s market\ncapitalization and capital structure are comparable to Delta’s; both firms are highly levered.\nIt is anticipated that Delta will issue new equity along with 5- and 10-year senior unsecured\ndebt to fund the acquisition, which will significantly increase its debt ratio.\n ",

As long as short-term interest rates\nadjust with expected inflation, cash is essentially a zero-duration, inflation-protected asset\nthat earns a floating real rate, which is typically procyclical. Wakuluk assumes short-term\ninterest rates adjust with expected inflation and are procyclical.

Pinho\nasks Flávia Silveira, a junior analyst, to complete an analysis of Adesivo S.A., Enviado S.A.,\nand Gesticular S.A.Pinho directs Silveira to use a valuation metric that would allow for a\nmeaningful ranking of relative value of the three companies’ shares. Exhibit 1 provides\nselected financial information for the three companies.\nSilveira reviews underlying trailing EPS for Adesivo. Adesivo has basic trailing EPS of\nBRL0.84. Silveira finds the following note in Adesivo’s financial statements:“On a per share\nbasis, Adesivo incurred in the last four quartersi. from a lawsuit, a non-recurring gain of\nBRL0.04; andii. from factory integration, a non-recurring cost of BRL0.03 and a recurring cost\nof BRL0.01 in increased depreciation.”Silveira notes that Adesivo is forecasted to pay\nsemiannual dividends of BRL0.24 next year. Silveira estimates five-year earnings growth rates\nfor the three companies, which are presented in Exhibit 2.\nPinho asks Silveira about the possible use of the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) in assessing the\nrelative value of the three companies. Silveira tells Pinho:Statement 1The P/S is not affected\nby revenue recognition practices.Statement 2The P/S is less subject to distortion from expense\naccounting than is the P/E.\nPinho asks Silveira about using the Fed and Yardeni models to assess the value of the equity\nmarket. Silveira states:Statement 3The Fed model concludes that the market is undervalued when\nthe market’s current earnings yield is greater than the 10-year Treasury bond yield.Statement\n4The Yardeni model includes the consensus five-year earnings growth rate forecast for the\nmarket index.\nSilveira also analyzes the three companies using the enterprising value (EV)-to-EBITDA\nmultiple. Silveira notes that the EBITDA for Gesticular for the most recent year is BRL560\nmillion and gathers other selected information on Gesticular, which is presented in Exhibit 4.\nPinho asks Silveira about the use of momentum indicators in assessing the shares of the three\ncompanies. Silveira states:Statement 5Relative-strength indicators compare an equity’s\nperformance during a period with the performance of some group of equities or its own past\nperformance.Statement 6In the calculation of standardized unexpected earnings (SUE), the\nmagnitude of unexpected earnings is typically scaled by the standard deviation of analysts’\nearnings forecasts.\n ",

Less-liquid asset classes\nshould have a wider, not narrower, corridor width. Less-liquid assets should have a wider\ncorridor to avoid frequent rebalancing costs.

Therefore, the DoGood Fund may be a free-rider on the\nactivism by these shareholders.\nNote 4: Of the four funds, the Elmer Fund is most likely to appeal to investors who want to\nminimize fees and believe that the market is efficient.\nNote 5: Adding investment-grade bonds to the Elmer Fund will decrease the portfolio’s short-\nterm risk.\nSmith discusses means of enhancing income for the three funds with the junior analyst, Kolton\nFrey, including engaging in securities lending or writing covered calls. Frey tells Smith the\nfollowing:\nStatement 1: Securities lending would increase income through reinvestment of the cash\ncollateral but would require the fund to miss out on dividend income from the lent securities.\nStatement 2: Writing covered calls would generate income, but doing so would limit the upside\nshare price appreciation for the underlying shares.\n ",

A widely used approach to\nsegment the equity universe incorporates two factors: size and style. Size is typically\nmeasured by market capitalization and often categorized as large cap, mid-cap, or small cap.\nStyle is typically classified as value, growth, or a blend of value and growth.",

To assess the\nvalue of their own firm, they are reviewing current financial data for Jupiter PLC, Saturn\nCorporation, and Voyager Corporation, three firms they believe are comparable to Moonbase.\nZin believes Moonbase should trade at similar multiples to these firms and that each valuation\nratio measure is equally valid. Moonbase has a current stock price of $34.00 per share,\nearnings of $1.75 per share, book value of $8.50 per share, and cash flow of $3.20 per share.\nUsing the average of each of the three multiples for the three comparable firms, Zin finds that\nMoonbase is undervalued.Lee states that the low valuation reflects current poor performance of\na subsidiary of Moonbase. She recommends that the board of directors consider divesting the\nsubsidiary in a manner that would provide cash inflow to Moonbase.Zin proposes that some action\nshould be taken before a hostile takeover bid is made. He asks Lee if changes can be made to\nthe corporate governance structure in order to make it more difficult for an unwanted suitor to\nsucceed.In response, Lee makes two comments of actions that would make a hostile takeover more\ndifficult. Lee's first comment is “Moonbase can institute a poison pill that allows our\nshareholders, other than the hostile bidder, to purchase shares at a substantial discount to\ncurrent market value.” Lee's second comment is: “Moonbase can instead institute a poison put.\nThe put allows shareholders the opportunity to redeem their shares at a substantial premium to\ncurrent market value.”Zin is also concerned about the general attitude of outside investors\nwith the governance of Moonbase. He has read brokerage reports indicating that the Moonbase\ngovernance ratings are generally low. Zin believes the following statements describe\ncharacteristics that should provide Moonbase with a strong governance rating.Statement 1:\nMoonbase's directors obtain advice from the corporate counsel to aid them in assessing the\nfirm's compliance with regulatory requirements.Statement 2: Five of the ten members of the\nboard of directors are not employed by Moonbase and are considered independent. Though not\nemployed by the company, two of the independent directors are former executives of the company\nand thus can contribute useful expertise relevant for the business.Statement 3: The audit\ncommittee of the board is organized so as to have sufficient resources to carry out its task,\nwith an internal staff that reports routinely and directly to the audit committee.Zin is\nparticularly proud of the fact that Moonbase has begun drafting a “Statement of Corporate\nGovernance” (SCG) that will be available on the company website for viewing by shareholders,\ninvestment analysts, and any interested stakeholders. In particular, the SCG pays special\nattention to policies that ensure effective contributions from the board of directors. These\npolicies include the following:Policy 1: Training is provided to directors prior to joining the\nboard and periodically thereafter.Policy 2: Statements are provided of management's assessment\nof the board's performance of its fiduciary responsibilities.Policy 3: Statements are provided\nof directors' responsibilities regarding oversight and monitoring of the firm's risk management\nand compliance functions.Zin concludes the discussion by announcing that Johann Steris, a\nhighly regarded ex-CFO of a major corporation, is under consideration as a member of an\nexpanded board of directors. Zin states that Steris meets all the requirements as an\nindependent director including the fact that he will not violate the interlocking directorship\nrequirement. Steris also will bring experience as a member of the compensation committee of the\nboard of another firm. He also comments that Steris desires to serve on either the audit or\ncompensation committee of the Moonbase board and that good governance practice suggests that\nSteris would not be prohibited from serving on either committee.\n ",

To value the FRA, the first step is to compute the new FRA rate, which is the rate on Day 90 of an FRA that expires in 90 days in which the underlying is the 90-day Libor, or FRA (90,90,90):\n\n$$\nFRA(g,h-g,m) = \\left\\{[1+L_g(h-g + m)t_{h-g+m}]-1\\right\\} / t_m\n$$\n\n$$\nFRA(90,90,90) = \\{ [1+L_{90}(180-90+90)(180/360)]-1\\} /(90/360)\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\{ [1+L_{90}(180-90)(90/360)]-1\\} /(90/360)\n$$\n\n$$\nFRA(90,90,90) = \\left\\{[1+L_{90}(180/360)]/[1+L_{90}(90)(90/360)]-1\\right\\}/(90/360)\n$$\n\nExhibit 7 indicates that L90 (180) = 0.95% and L90 (90) = 0.90%, so\n\n$$\nFRA (90, 90, 90) = \n$$ \n$$\n([1 + 0.0095(180/360) / [1 + 0.0090(90/360)] - 1) / (90/360) \n$$\n$$\nFRA (90, 90, 90) = ([(1.00475/1.00225) - 1] (4) = 0.0025 or 0.9978\n$$\n\nTherefore, given the FRA rate at initiation of 0.70% and notional principal of $20 million from Exhibit 1, the current value of the forward contract is calculated as\n\n$$\nV_g= \\{\\$ 20,000,000 [(0.9978 - 0.0070)(90/360)]/[ 1+0.0095 (180/360)] V90 (0, 180,90). = \\$ 14, 887.75/ 1.00475 = \\$ 14,817.37. \n$$",

If consumers are more interested in hedging than\nproducers are, the futures price will exceed the spot price.In contrast, the insurance theory\npredicts that the futures price has to be lower than the current spot price as a form of\npayment or remuneration to the speculator who takes on the price risk and provides price\ninsurance to the commodity seller.

        "Share Context": "Adam Craw, CFA, is chief executive officer (CEO) of Crawfood, a European private equity\nfirm specializing in food retailers. The retail food industry has been consolidating during the\npast two years as private equity funds have closed numerous deals and taken many companies\nprivate.Crawfood recently hired Lillian Voser, a CFA Level II candidate, as a controller. On\nVoser's first day of work, the head of personnel informs her that by signing the employment\ncontract, Voser agrees to comply with the company's code of ethics and compliance manual. She\nhands Voser copies of the code and compliance manual without further comment. Voser spends the\nnext hour reading both documents. An excerpt from the compliance manual appears in Exhibit 1.\nWhen she enters her new office that afternoon, Voser finds a large gift basket sent by her\nsister. The card reads “Congratulations on your new position.” The basket is filled with\nexpensive high-quality food items from Greenhornfood—a local small, publicly-traded food\nretailer, which produces many delicatessen products under its own brand name.During the next\ntwo weeks, Voser meets with all of Crawfood's upper management, including the CEO. In his\noffice, Craw praises Voser's efforts to complete the CFA program. “The program is demanding,\nbut it is worthwhile.” Craw then explains his investment strategy for choosing Crawfood's\nacquisition targets. He points to a large map on the wall with multi-colored pins marking\nCrawfood's previous takeovers. The map shows acquisitions in all the major cities of Germany\nwith one exception—the home of Crawfood headquarters. Craw remarks, “We are currently in\ntalks for another purchase. Confidentiality prohibits me from discussing it any further, but\nyou will hear more about it soon.”Introduced to Greenhornfood by her sister, Voser quickly\nbecomes a loyal customer. She considers it the best food retailer in the vicinity and she\nfrequently purchases its products.The following week, the local newspaper features an article\nabout Greenhornfood and its young founders. The article describes the company's loyal and\ngrowing customer base as well as its poor quarterly financial results. Voser notes that the\nstock has steadily declined during the past twelve months. She concludes that the company has\nan inexperienced management team, but its popular product line and loyal customer base make the\ncompany a potential acquisition target. Voser calls her sister and recommends that she purchase\nGreenhornfood shares because “it would be an attractive acquisition for a larger company.”\nBased on Voser's recommendation, her sister buys €3,000 worth of shares.During the following\ntwo weeks the stock price of Greenhornfood continues to decline. Voser's sister is uncertain of\nwhat she should do with her position. She seeks Voser's advice. Voser recommends that her\nsister wait another few days before making her decision and promises to analyze the situation\nin the meantime.While walking by Craw's office the following day, Voser sees a document with\nGreenhornfood's distinctive logo and overhears the company's name through an open office door.\nThat evening, Voser tells her sister, “with the price decline, the stock is even more\nattractive.” She recommends that her sister increase her position. Based on her recommendation\nher sister buys an additional €3,000 worth of Greenhornfood shares.One month later, Crawfood\npublicly announces the acquisition of Greenhornfood Company at a 20% premium to the previous\nday's closing price. Following the announcement, Voser's sister boasts about Voser's excellent\nrecommendation and timing to her broker.Regulatory authorities initiate an investigation into\nsuspicious trading in Greenhornfood shares and options preceding the formal announcement of the\nacquisition. Craw receives a letter from regulatory authorities stating that he is the subject\nof a formal investigation into his professional conduct surrounding the acquisition. He learns\nfrom the compliance officer that Voser is also under investigation. The compliance officer\nprovides no details and out of respect for Voser's privacy, Craw makes no inquiries.The\nsituation remains unchanged and the matter is still pending with regulatory authorities several\nmonths later when Craw receives his annual Professional Conduct Statement (PCS) from CFA\nInstitute. He reviews the text asking “In the last two years, have you been . . . the subject\nof…any investigation…in which your professional conduct, in either a direct or supervisory\ncapacity, was at issue?”\n ",

        "Share Context": "Hiram Life (Hiram), a large multinational insurer located in Canada, has received\npermission to increase its ownership in an India-based life insurance company, LICIA, from 26%\nto 49%. Before completing this transaction, Hiram wants to complete a risk assessment of\nLICIA's investment portfolio. Judith Hamilton, Hiram's chief financial officer, has been asked\nto brief the management committee on investment risk in its India-based insurance\noperations.LICIA's portfolio, which has a market value of CAD 260 million, is currently\nstructured as shown in Exhibit 1. Despite its more than 1,000 individual holdings, the\nportfolio is invested predominantly in India. The Indian government bond market is highly\nliquid, but the country's mortgage and infrastructure loan markets, as well as the corporate\nbond market, are relatively illiquid. Individual mortgage and corporate bond positions are\nlarge relative to the normal trading volumes in these securities. Given the elevated current\nand fiscal account deficits, Indian investments are also subject to above-average economic\nrisk.Hamilton begins with a summary of the India-based portfolio. Exhibit 1 presents the\ncurrent portfolio composition and the risk and return assumptions used to esti?mate value at\nrisk (VaR).\nInfrastructure is a rapidly growing asset class with limited return history; the first\ninfrastructure loans were issued just 10 years ago.Hamilton's report to the management\ncommittee must outline her assumptions and provide support for the methods she used in her risk\nassessment. If needed, she will also make recommendations for rebalancing the portfolio to\nensure its risk profile is aligned with that of Hiram.Hamilton develops the assumptions shown\nin Exhibit 2, which will be used for estimating the portfolio VaR.\nHamilton elects to apply a one-day, 5% VaR limit of CAD 2 million in her risk assessment of\nLICIA,s portfolio. This limit is consistent with the risk tolerance the committee has specified\nfor the Hiram portfolio.The markets' volatility during the last 12 months has been\nsignificantly higher than the historical norm, with increased frequency of large daily losses,\nand Hamilton expects the next 12 months to be equally volatile.She estimates the one-day 5%\nportfolio VaR for LICIA's portfolio using three different approaches:\nThe committee is likely to have questions in a number of key areas—the limitations of the VaR\nreport, potential losses in an extreme adverse event, and the reliability of the VaR numbers if\nthe market continues to exhibit higher-than-normal volatility. Hamilton wants to be certain\nthat she has thoroughly evaluated the risks inherent in the LICIA portfolio and compares them\nwith the risks in Hiram's present portfolio.Hamilton believes the possibility of a ratings\ndowngrade on Indian sovereign debt is high and not yet fully reflected in securities prices. If\nthe rating is lowered, many of the portfolio's holdings will no longer meet Hiram's minimum\nratings requirement. A downgrade's effect is unlikely to be limited to the government bond\nportfolio. All asset classes can be expected to be affected to some degree. Hamilton plans to\ninclude a scenario analysis that reflects this possibility to ensure that management has the\nbroadest possible view of the risk exposures in the India portfolio.\n ",

        "Explanation": "Strategy 6 is a bear spread, which is a combination of a long put option and a\nshort put option on the same underlying, where the long put has a higher strike price than the\nshort put. In the case of Strategy 6, the April €31.00 put option would be purchased and the\nApril €25.00 put option would be sold. The long put premium is €3.00 and the short put\npremium is €0.50, for a net cost of €2.50. The breakeven share price is €28.50, calculated\nas XH – (pH – pL) = €31.00 – (€3.00 – €0.50) = €28.50.",

Schmidt's supervisor asks him to develop estimates\nfor GDP growth for three countries. Information on the three countries is provided in Exhibit\n1.\nAfter gathering additional data on the three countries, Schmidt shares his findings with\ncolleague, Sean O'Leary. After reviewing the data, O'Leary notes the following\nobservations:Observation 1:The stock market of Country A has appreciated considerably over the\npast several years. Also, the ratio of corporate profits to GDP for Country A has been trending\nupward over the past several years and is now well above its historical average.Observation\n2:The government of Country C is working hard to bridge the gap between its standard of living\nand that of developed countries. Currently, the rate of potential GDP growth in Country C is\nhigh.Schmidt knows that a large part of the analysis of sovereign credit is to develop a\nthorough understanding of what the potential GDP growth rate is for a particular country and\nthe region in which the country is located. Schmidt is also doing research on Country D for a\nclient of the firm. Selected economic facts on Country D are provided in Exhibit 2.\nPrior to wrapping up his research, Schmidt schedules a final meeting with O'Leary to see if he\ncan provide any other pertinent information. O'Leary makes the following statements to\nSchmidt:Statement 1:Many countries that have the same population growth rate, savings rate, and\nproduction function will have growth rates that converge over time.Statement 2:Convergence\nbetween countries can occur more quickly if economies are open and there is free trade and\ninternational borrowing and lending; however, there is no permanent increase in the rate of\ngrowth in an economy from a more open trade policy.\n ",

        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "A high growth rate of potential GDP would cause real incomes to rise more rapidly\nand also translate into higher real interest rates and higher expected/required real asset\nreturns. The real interest rate is essentially the real return that consumers/savers demand in\nexchange for postponing consumption. Faster growth in potential GDP means that consumers expect\ntheir real income to rise more rapidly. This implies that an extra unit of future\nincome/consumption is less valuable than it would be if income were expected to grow more\nslowly. All else the same, the real interest rate will have to be relatively high in order to\ninduce the savings required to fund required/desired capital accumulation.",

It is\nlikely that Country D is experiencing the Dutch Disease, where currency appreciation driven by\nstrong export demand for natural resources makes other segments of the economy, in particular\nmanufacturing, globally uncompetitive. Strong manufacturing exports would indicate that Country\nD is globally competitive and likely to have adopted leading edge technology. Thus, it is\nunlikely that the slow growth reflects inability to maintain productivity growth. Similarly,\nstrong exports would suggest adequate demand for its products. Thus, strong exports are\nunlikely to be the cause of slow growth.",
