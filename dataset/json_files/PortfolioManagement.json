Before completing this transaction, Hiram wants to complete a risk assessment of\nLICIA's investment portfolio. Judith Hamilton, Hiram's chief financial officer, has been asked\nto brief the management committee on investment risk in its India-based insurance\noperations.LICIA's portfolio, which has a market value of CAD 260 million, is currently\nstructured as shown in Exhibit 1.

The Indian government bond market is highly\nliquid, but the country's mortgage and infrastructure loan markets, as well as the corporate\nbond market, are relatively illiquid. Individual mortgage and corporate bond positions are\nlarge relative to the normal trading volumes in these securities. Given the elevated current\nand fiscal account deficits, Indian investments are also subject to above-average economic\nrisk.Hamilton begins with a summary of the India-based portfolio.

If needed, she will also make recommendations for rebalancing the portfolio to\nensure its risk profile is aligned with that of Hiram.Hamilton develops the assumptions shown\nin Exhibit 2, which will be used for estimating the portfolio VaR.\nHamilton elects to apply a one-day, 5% VaR limit of CAD 2 million in her risk assessment of\nLICIA,s portfolio. This limit is consistent with the risk tolerance the committee has specified\nfor the Hiram portfolio.The markets' volatility during the last 12 months has been\nsignificantly higher than the historical norm, with increased frequency of large daily losses,\nand Hamilton expects the next 12 months to be equally volatile.She estimates the one-day 5%\nportfolio VaR for LICIA's portfolio using three different approaches:\nThe committee is likely to have questions in a number of key areas—the limitations of the VaR\nreport, potential losses in an extreme adverse event, and the reliability of the VaR numbers if\nthe market continues to exhibit higher-than-normal volatility. Hamilton wants to be certain\nthat she has thoroughly evaluated the risks inherent in the LICIA portfolio and compares them\nwith the risks in Hiram's present portfolio.Hamilton believes the possibility of a ratings\ndowngrade on Indian sovereign debt is high and not yet fully reflected in securities prices.

Gorver and Abell are also assessing Eastern\nRegional's overall risk exposure.Eastern Regional Bank Fixed-Income Investment PortfolioThe\nbank's proprietary fixed-income portfolio is structured as a barbell portfolio: About half of\nthe portfolio is invested in zero-coupon Treasuries with maturities in the 3- to 5-year range\n(Portfolio P\n\n), and the remainder is invested in zero-coupon Treasuries with maturities in the 10- to 15-\nyear range (Portfolio P\n\n. Georges Montes, the portfolio manager, has discretion to allocate between 40% and 60% of the\nassets to each maturity “bucket” He must remain fully invested at all times. Exhibit 1 shows\ndetails of this portfolio.\nTrust Department's Equity Funda) Use of Options: The trust department of Eastern Regional Bank\nmanages an equity fund called the Index Plus Fund, with $325 million in assets. This fund's\nobjective is to track the S&P 500 Index price return while producing an income return 1.5 times\nthat of the S&P 500. The bank's chief investment officer (CIO) uses put and call options on S&P\n500 stock index futures to adjust the risk exposure of certain client accounts that have an\ninvestment in this fund. The portfolio of a 60-year-old widow with a below-average risk\ntolerance has an investment in this fund, and the CIO has asked his assistant, Janet Ferrell,\nto propose an options strategy to bring the portfolio's delta to 0.90.b) Value at Risk: The\nIndex Plus Fund has a one-day 95% value at risk (VaR) of $6.5 million. Gorver asks Abell to\nwrite a brief summary of the portfolio VaR for the report he is preparing on the fund's risk\nposition.\nCombined Bank Risk ExposuresThe bank has adopted a new risk policy, which requires forward-\nlooking risk assessments in addition to the measures that look at historical risk\ncharacteristics. Management has also become very focused on tail risk since the subprime crisis\nand is evaluating the bank's capital allocation to certain higher-risk lines of business.\nGorver must determine what additional risk metrics to include in his risk reporting to address\nthe new policy. He asks Abell to draft a section of the risk report that will address the risk\nmeasures' adequacy for capital allocation decisions.\n "

            "Kata Rom is an equity analyst working for Gimingham Wealth Partners (GWP), a large\ninvestment advisory company. Rom meets with Goran Galic, a Canadian private wealth client, to\nexplain investment strategies used by GWP to generate portfolio alpha for its clients.\nRom states that GWP is recognized in the Canadian investment industry as a leading factor-based\nvalue portfolio manager and describes how GWP creates relevant investment strategies and\nexplains GWP’s backtesting process. Rom notes the following:\nStatement 1: Using historical data, backtesting approximates a real-life investment process to\nillustrate the risk–return tradeoff of a particular proposed investment strategy.\nStatement 2: Backtesting is used almost exclusively by quantitative investment managers and\nrarely by fundamental investment managers, who are more concerned with information such as\nforward estimates of company earnings, macroeconomic factors, and intrinsic values.\nGalic, who is 62 years old, decides to allocate C$2 million (representing 10% of his net worth)\nto an account with GWP and stipulates that portfolio assets be restricted exclusively to\ndomestic securities. Although GWP has not backtested its strategies with such a restriction, it\nhas backtested its strategies using a global index that includes domestic securities. Rom shows\nthe following risk measures to Galic for three factor portfolios.\nGalic asks Rom, “What happens if the future is different from the past?” Rom gives the\nfollowing replies:\nStatement 3: Although backtesting can offer some comfort, you are correct that it does have a\nweakness: Backtesting generally does not capture the dynamic nature of financial markets and in\nparticular may not capture extreme downside risk.\nStatement 4: As a result, we have captured extreme downside risk and the dynamic nature of\nfinancial markets by using the Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at- Risk measures.\nIn an effort to make Galic fully aware of the risks inherent in GWP’s strategies, Rom\ndescribes a recent study that investigated the return distributions of value and momentum\nfactors that GWP uses to construct portfolios.

Rom informs Galic that GWP also uses a technique commonly referred to as\nscenario analysis to examine how strategies perform in different structural regimes. Exhibit 2\ncompares the performance of two of GWP’s factor allocation strategies in different regimes:\nGalic is surprised to see that some of the backtest results are unfavorable.

        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Statement 2 is correct. A significant advantage of the ETF creation/ redemption\nprocess is that the AP absorbs all costs of transacting the securities for the fund’s\nportfolio. APs pass these costs to investors in the ETF’s bid–ask spread, incurred by ETF\nbuyers and sellers. Thus, non-transacting shareholders of an ETF are shielded from the negative\nimpact of transaction costs caused by other investors entering and exiting the fund. In\ncontrast, when investors enter or exit a traditional mutual fund, the mutual fund manager\nincurs costs to buy or sell investments arising from this activity, which affects all fund\nshareholders. This makes the ETF structure inherently fairer: Frequent ETF traders bear the\ncost of their activity, while buy-and-hold ETF shareholders are shielded from those costs.\nInvestors cannot short mutual fund shares, but they can short ETF shares. Also, if ETF shares\nare trading at a discount to NAV and arbitrage costs are sufficiently low, APs will buy ETF\nshares and exchange them for the securities in the redemption basket. Statement 3 describes the\nscenario that would occur if the ETF shares are trading at a premium to NAV.\nA is incorrect because Statement 1 is incorrect. Investors cannot short mutual fund shares, but\nthey can short ETF shares.\nC is incorrect because Statement 3 is incorrect. If ETF shares are trading at a discount to NAV\nand arbitrage costs are sufficiently low, APs will buy ETF shares and exchange them for the\nsecurities in the redemption basket. Statement 3 describes the scenario that would occur if ETF\nshares are trading at a premium to NAV.",

These discrepancies can lead to greater\ntracking error for portfolios holding ADRs in lieu of the underlying local shares. Further, ETF\nsponsors that engage in securities lending can generate additional portfolio income to help\noffset fund expenses, thereby lowering tracking error. ETF 2 uses a full replication approach,\nholds only local foreign shares, and engages in securities lending. Therefore, ETF 2 will\nlikely have the lowest tracking error out of the ETFs in Exhibit 1. ETF 3 will likely have\ngreater tracking error than ETF 2 because it is managed using a representative sampling\napproach and is invested in depositary receipts in lieu of local shares.

            "Michael Bloomfield is a trader at 2Fast Trading, a proprietary trading company that\nuses machine learning and algorithms to execute trades. He works with Amy Riley, a junior\ntrader at the company. Bloomfield and Riley meet to review the company’s trading systems and\nseveral trades in Bloomfield’s trading account.\nThey discuss the increasing impact of market fragmentation on available liquidity for the\ncompany’s trading strategies. Riley makes the following comments regarding market\nfragmentation:\nComment 1: Liquidity aggregation and smart order routing help traders manage the challenges and\nopportunities presented by fragmentation.\nComment 2: With increasing market fragmentation, traders who fill large orders now search for\nliquidity across multiple venues and across time to control market impact.\nBloomfield tells Riley that he noticed trades of 500 shares of BYYP stock were executed every\n20 minutes for an hour. Bloomfield saw the same pattern of trading in the stock during the\nprevious trading day. He instructs Riley to submit an order to purchase BYYP shares on the\nassumption that a trader seeks liquidity and is executing a large buy order by breaking it into\npieces. The prices of these trades and the best bids and offers in the market when the BYYP\ntrades occurred are presented in Exhibit 1.\nBloomfield shifts the conversation to AXZ Corp. Bloomfield notes that AXZ’s bid–ask spread is\nnarrow, even though AXZ’s share price has been experiencing a period of high volatility. After\nextensive research, Bloomfield will purchase AXZ shares using a trading strategy that does not\ninclude standing orders.\nBloomfield then assesses the risks that 2Fast’s electronic trading strategies introduce into\nthe market. He is concerned that these risks may bring on more regulation. Bloomfield claims\nthat the risks can be reduced by changing the structure of the market, and those structural\nchanges can maintain 2Fast’s primary competitive advantage, which is trading faster than\ncompetitors.\nBloomfield mentions that a regulatory body is investigating a competitor’s trading practices.\nThe investigation involves a tip that the competitor is manipulating markets by submitting\norders and arranging trades to influence other traders’ perceptions of value. Specifically,\nregulators were informed that the competitor has been buying stock to raise its price, thereby\nencouraging momentum traders to buy, and then selling the stock to them at higher prices. The\nregulator confirmed that the competitor did not use standing limit orders or commonly\ncontrolled accounts for the trades under investigation.\n "

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Flickering quotes are exposed limit orders that electronic traders submit and then\ncancel shortly thereafter, often within a second. Electronic dealers and algorithmic buy-side\ntraders submit and repeatedly cancel and resubmit their orders when they do not want their\norders to stand in the market; rather, they want other traders to see that they are willing to\ntrade at the displayed price. Bloomfield does not want his orders to stand in the market; using\nflickering quotes to purchase AXZ shares would satisfy that objective.\nB is incorrect because AXZ shares are currently in a period of high volatility, so Bloomfield\nwould not likely use machine learning to execute his trades. Machine-learning systems\nfrequently do not produce useful information during volatility episodes because these episodes\nhave few precedents from which the machines can learn. Machine-learning methods produce models\nbased on observed empirical regularities rather than on theoretical principles identified by\nanalysts. Many traders shut down when volatility spikes, both because high-volatility episodes\nare uncommon and thus not well understood and because even if such episodes were well\nunderstood, they represent periods of exceptionally high risk.\nC is incorrect because market participants use leapfrogging quotes when spreads are wide (not\nnarrow), and Bloomfield noted that the bid–ask spread for AXZ shares is narrow. When bid–ask\nspreads are wide, dealers often are willing to trade at better prices than they quote. They\nquote wide spreads because they hope to trade at more favorable prices. When another trader\nquotes a better price, dealers often immediately quote an even better price. If the spread is\nsufficiently wide, a game of leapfrog may ensue as the dealer jumps ahead again.",

        "explanation": "To reduce the systemic risks associated with fast trading, some exchanges have\nadopted trade halts when prices move too quickly. These rules stop trading when excess demand\nfor liquidity occurs. They also prevent the extreme price changes that can occur in electronic\nmarkets when market orders arrive and no liquidity is present. 2Fast Trading’s competitive\nadvantage will be maintained despite exchange trading halts because the company will be free to\ntrade faster than its competitors once trading resumes. Therefore, exchanges using trade halts\nto stop trading is the risk reduction strategy that most likely maintains 2Fast Trading’s\ncompetitive advantage and is consistent with Bloomfield’s claim that risks can be reduced by\nchanging the structure of the market.\nA is incorrect because delaying order processing by random intervals reduces the benefits of\nhigh-frequency traders being faster than their competitors and investing in speed. Therefore,\ndelaying order processing by random order intervals does not maintain 2Fast Trading’s primary\ncompetitive advantage, which is trading faster than competitors, because that advantage will be\nreduced.\nC is incorrect because slowing markets by running call markets once a second or more often\ninstead of trading continuously diminishes the benefits of high-frequency traders being faster\nthan their competitors and investing with speed.

If market volatility during the last year is lower than in the lookback period, the\nportfolio could accumulate a substantial loss without technically breaching the VaR\nconstraint.A is incorrect because VaR was calculated using historical simulation, so the\ndistribution used was based on actual historical changes in the key risk factors experienced\nduring the lookback period. Thus, the distribution is not characterized using estimates of the\nmean return, the standard deviation, or the correlations among the risk factors in the\nportfolio. In contrast, the parametric method of estimating VaR generally assumes that the\ndistribution of returns for the risk factors is normal.B is incorrect because a specification\nwith a higher confidence level will produce a higher VaR. If a 99% confidence interval was used\nto calculate historical VaR, the VaR would be larger (larger expected minimum loss). During the\nlast year, none of Flusk's losses were substantial enough to breach the 5% VaR number (95%\nconfidence interval); therefore, if McKee used a 1% VaR (99% confidence interval), the number\nof VaR breaches would not change.",

Historical yields drive the pricing of bonds more than the price\nhistory or the current duration. Historical prices for the fixed-income positions currently\nheld in the portfolio may not exist, and even when historical prices do exist, they may not be\nrelevant to the current characteristics (e.g., maturity) of the instrument. Even if the same\nbonds existed at the time of the latest financial crisis, their durations would change because\nof the passage of time.A is incorrect because using a bond’s past price history would\nmischaracterize the risk of the current portfolio holdings. For this reason, the historical\nyields are more important in explaining the risks. Historical prices for the fixed-income\npositions currently held in the portfolio may not exist, and even when historical prices do\nexist, they may not be relevant to the current characteristics (e.g., maturity) of the\ninstrument.C is incorrect because historical bond durations would not capture the current\ncharacteristics of the bonds in the portfolio. Duration is a sensitivity measure and is the\nweighted-average time to maturity of a bond.

They require less physical space than do trading floors, and in contrast to\nfloor-based trading systems, they do not require exchange officials to record and report\nprices. Furthermore, the widespread use of electronic trading systems significantly decreased\ntrading costs for buy-side traders. Costs fell as exchanges obtained greater cost efficiencies\nfrom using electronic matching systems instead of floor-based manual trading systems. These\ntechnologies also decreased costs and increased efficiencies for the deal-ers and arbitrageurs\nwho provide much of the liquidity offered at exchanges. Competition forced them to pass along\nmuch of the benefits of their new tech-nologies to buy-side traders in the form of narrower\nspreads quoted for larger sizes. New electronic buy-side order management systems also\ndecreased buy-side trading costs by allowing a smaller number of buy-side traders to process\nmore orders and to process them more efficiently than manual traders.While electronic trading\nhas had a significant effect on equity markets, it has not had as much of an effect on the\nmarkets for corporate and municipal bonds. The market structures of corporate and municipal\nbond markets have hardly changed since the late 19th century. Despite the efforts of many\ncreative developers of electronic bond trading systems, most public investors in these markets\nstill trade largely over the counter with dealers.",

The Sharpe ratio represents a backward-looking return-based measure and is used\nto assess the skill of the manager.C is incorrect because VaR does not provide an accurate risk\nestimate in either trending or volatile regimes. A portfolio might remain under its VaR limit\nevery day but lose an amount approaching this limit each day. Under such circum-stances, the\nportfolio could accumulate substantial losses without technically breaching the VaR constraint.\nAlso, during periods of low volatility, VaR will appear quite low, underestimating the losses\nthat could occur when the envi-ronment returns to a normal level of volatility.",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The change in value of a bond is inversely related to a change in yield. Given a\nbond priced at B with duration D and yield change of Δy, the rate of return or percentage\nprice change for the bond is approximately given as follows: ΔB/B ≈ ?DΔy/(1 + y). Under\nScenario 3, interest rates decrease by 20 bps. In an environment of decreasing interest rates,\nthe bond with the highest duration will have the greatest positive return. Bond 3 has a\nduration of 10.2, which is greater than that of both Bond 1 (duration = 1.3) and Bond 2\n(duration = 3.7).",

            "Carol Kynnersley is the chief risk officer at Investment Management Advisers (IMA).\nKynnersley meets with IMA's portfolio management team and investment advisers to discuss the\nmethods used to measure and manage market risk and how risk metrics are presented in client\nreports.The three most popular investment funds offered by IMA are the Equity Opportunities,\nthe Diversified Fixed Income, and the Alpha Core Equity. The Equity Opportunities Fund is\ncomposed of two exchange-traded funds: a broadly diversi-fied large-cap equity product and one\ndevoted to energy stocks. Kynnersley makes the following statements regarding the risk\nmanagement policies established for the Equity Opportunities portfolio:Statement 1 IMA's\npreferred approach to model value at risk (VaR) is to estimate expected returns, volatilities,\nand correlations under the assumption of a normal distribution.Statement 2 In last year's\nannual client performance report, IMA stated that a hypothetical $6 million Equity\nOpportunities Fund account had a daily 5% VaR of approximately 1.5% of portfolio\nvalue.Kynnersley informs the investment advisers that the risk management department recently\nupdated the model for estimating the Equity Opportunities Fund VaR based on the information\npresented in Exhibit 1.\nFor clients interested in fixed-income products, IMA offers the Diversified Fixed-Income Fund.\nKynnersley explains that the portfolio's bonds are all subject to interest rate risk. To\ndemonstrate how fixed-income exposure measures can be used to identify and manage interest rate\nrisk, Kynnersley distributes two exhibits featuring three hypothetical Treasury coupon bonds\n(Exhibit 2) under three interest rate scenarios (Exhibit 3).\n \nOne of the investment advisers comments that a client recently asked about the performance of\nthe Diversified Fixed-Income Fund relative to its benchmark, a broad fixed-income index.\nKynnersley informs the adviser as follows:Statement 3 The Diversified Fixed-Income Fund manager\nmonitors the historical deviation between portfolio returns and benchmark returns. The fund\nprospectus stipulates a target deviation from the bench-mark of no more than 5 bps.Kynnersley\nconcludes the meeting by reviewing the constraints IMA imposes on securities included in the\nAlpha Core Equity Fund. The compliance department conducts daily oversight using numerous risk\nscreens and, when indicated, notifies portfolio managers to make adjustments. Kynnersley makes\nthe following statement:Statement 4 It is important that all clients investing in the fund be\nmade aware of IMA's compliance measures. The Alpha Core Equity Fund restricts the exposure of\nindividual securities to 1.75% of the total portfolio.\n "
