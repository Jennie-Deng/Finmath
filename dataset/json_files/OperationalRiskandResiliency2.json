        "question_text": "Risk aggregation is one of the challenging areas within the economic capital implementation\nframework. Risk aggregation involves identifying the individual risk types and making certain\nchoices in aggregating those risk types. Classification by risk types (market, credit,\noperational, and business) may be approximate and prone to error. For example, the definitions\nof risk types may differ across banks or within a given bank, which complicates the aggregation\nprocess. Most banks begin by aggregating risk into silos by risk-type across the entire bank.\nOther banks prefer using business unit silos, while others combine both approaches. Which of\nthe following statements regarding risk aggregation is correct?",
