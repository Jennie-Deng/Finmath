Assume for instance that the swap andTreasury rates are initially\n5.5% and 5%. If these rates change to 5.3% and4.5%, for example, both values for the swap and\nthe Treasury bond wouldincrease. Because the drop in the Treasury rate is larger, however, the\npriceof the Treasury bond would fall more than the swap, leading to a net loss onthe position.\nThe strategy should gain from decreases in the Swap-Treasuryspread, so a. is wrong. The\nstrategy should gain from increases in the Treasuryrate, all else equal, so b. is wrong.\nFinally, the distribution of the payoffdepends on the distribution of the swap-Treasury spread.\nBecause this cannot gobelow zero, there is a limit on the upside.

Earlier this year, both companies introduced new hybrid models that are comparable\nto each other in almost every category. However, after both companies release pricing for their\nnew models, LM’s model is 20% less expensive than GV’s. As a result, GV’s stock price\ndeclined sharply while LM’s stock price rose dramatically. Subsequently LM and GV announce\nthat they have entered into merger discussions where the terms of the planned merger would give\nGV shareholders 1 share of LM per 3 shares of GV previously held.

If\nthemerger is completed, LM’s stock will appreciate and/or GV’s stock willdepreciate relative\nto each other until the ratio reaches 3:1. In order to exploit this potential arbitrage\nopportunity,you can short 300 shares of the relatively overvalued stock GV, resulting in acash\ninflow of USD 6000, while buying 100 shares of the relatively undervaluedstock LM for USD 5800,\nresulting in a net cash inflow of USD 200.

In addition, the\nimmediate response from the government — cutting interest rates — to salvage the situation,\ncaused bond yields to decline by 2%.

The initial surplus\nis calculated as S0 =A0 – L0 = 350 – 180 = 170, where A0 = thefirm’s initial assets and L0\nthe firm’s initial liabilities.Next we have to calculate the surplus at the end of 2008.Given\nthe 50% decline in the equity market, the new level of assets A1 at theend of 2008 is equal to:\n(1 – 0.5) * 350, or 175The new level of liabilities L1 can be calculated as:L1 = (1 – (MD *\nΔy)) * L0where MD is the modified duration, and Δy is the change in yield.Liabilities at end\nof 2008 are equal to:L1= (1 – (14 * -0.02)) * 180 = 230.4. Therefore, the 2008 surplus S1 is\nequal to A1 – L1 = 175 – 230.4 = -55.4 (which implies the pension fund isactually in a\ndeficit situation at the end of 2008). The change in surplus for2008 is hence S1 – S0 = -55.4\n– 170 = -225.4 million.(6)",

However, screening does not necessarily select\nstocks evenly acrosssectors and can ignore entire sectors or classes of stocks entirely if they\ndonot pass the screen. Therefore, risk control in a screening process isfragmentary at best.\nStratification separates stocks into categories (forexample, economic sectors) and implements\nrisk control by ensuring that theweighting in each sector matches the benchmark weighting.\nTherefore, it doesnot allow for overweighting or underweighting specific categories.Linear\nprogramming does not necessarily select theportfolio with the lowest level of active risk.\nRather, it attempts to improveon stratification by introducing many more dimensions of risk\ncontrol andensuring that the portfolio approximates the benchmark for all thesedimensions. (3)",
