        "explanation": "Answer: C Fixed exchange rates impose severe limitations on the exercise of\nindependent monetary policy. With a rigidly fixed exchange rate, domestic interest rates,\nmonetary aggregates (e.g., money supply), and credit conditions are dictated by the requirement\nto buy/sell the currency at the rigid paarity. Even a narrow band around the parity level\nallows the monetary authority to exercise some discretionary control over these conditions. In\ngeneral, the wider the band, the more independent control the monetary authority can exercise.\n在实践中，固定汇率制度和目标区制度都允许汇率在平价水平附近的波动区间内浮动。设立该波段最有可能\n的理由是，该波段允许金融管理局: 固定汇率严重限制了独立货币政策的实施。在严格固定的汇率下，国内\n利率、货币总量(例如，货币供应量)和信贷条件都取决于在严格平价下买卖货币的要求。即便是平价水平附\n近的窄幅波动，也允许货币当局对这些情况行使一定的自由裁量权。一般而言，波动区间越宽，英国金融管\n理局(monetary authority，简称:金管局)的控制权就越独立。",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Answer: A A devaluation of the domestic currency means domestic producers are\ncutting the price faced by their foreign customers. The impact on their unit sales and their\nrevenue depends on the elasticity of demand. Expensive luxury goods exhibit high price\nelasticity. Hence, luxury car producers are likely to experience a sharp increase in sales and\nrevenue due to the devaluation. 一个大型工业化国家最近为了纠正持续的贸易逆差而使其货币贬值。下\n列哪个国内产业最有可能从货币贬值中获益? 本币贬值意味着国内生产商正在降低外国客户面临的价格。其\n对单位销售和收入的影响取决于需求弹性。昂贵的奢侈品表现出很高的价格弹性。因此，由于货币贬值，豪\n华车生产商可能会经历销量和收入的大幅增长。",
