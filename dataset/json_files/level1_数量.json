B is incorrect because discrete data are numerical values that result from a counting\nprocess, and therefore the data are limited to a finite number of values. The proprietary model\nused can generate probabilities that can take any value between 0 and 1; therefore, the set of\nbankruptcy probabilities would not be characterized as discrete data. C是正确的。连续数据是可以\n测量的数据，可以在指定的值范围内采用任何数值。在这种情况下，分析员正在估计破产概率，它可以取0到\n1之间的任何值。因此，分析师估计的破产概率集可能被描述为连续数据。 A是不正确的，因为排序数据是可\n以逻辑排序或排序的分类数据。因此，破产概率集不会被描述为排序数据。 B是不正确的，因为离散数据是\n由计数过程产生的数值，因此数据仅限于有限数量的值。使用的专有模型生成概率可以取0到1之间的任何值\n，故破产概率集不会被描述为离散数据。",

Since it is false, student’s t-distribution has longer (fatter)\ntails thanthe normal distribution and, therefore, it may provide a more reliable,\nmoreconservative downside risk estimate. 题目要选择错误的选项： 因为与正态分布相比，t分布的尾部\n是更肥的，因此，它可以提供更可靠、更保守的下行风险估计。故选项B的说法错误的。 故选项B是本题正确\n的选项。",

        "explanation": "A is correct. P(8% ≤ Portfolio return ≤ 11%) = N(Z corresponding to 11%) –N(Z\ncorresponding to 8%). For the first term, Z = (11% – 8%)/14% = 0.21 approximately, and using\nthe table of cumulative normal distribution given in the problem, N(0.21) = 0.5832. To get the\nsecond term immediately, note that 8 percent is the mean, and for the normal distribution 50\npercent of the probability lies on either side of the mean. Therefore, N(Z corresponding to 8%)\nmust equal 50 percent. So P(8% ≤ Portfolio return ≤ 11%) = 0.5832 – 0.50 = 0.0832 or\napproximately 8.3 percent. A正确。 P(8%≤投资组合收益率≤11%)= N(11%对应的Z值) -N(8%对应的Z值\n)。 对于上面公式中的第一项11%对应的Z值，Z =(11% - 8%)/14%约等于0.21，利用累积正态分布表\n，N(0.21) = 0.5832。 8%是均值，正态分布中，50%的观测值落在均值左侧，另外50%落在均值右侧，因此\n，N(8%均值对应的Z值)一定等于50%。 因此，P(8%≤投资组合收益率≤11%)= 0.5832 - 0.50 = 0.0832或大\n约8.3%。",
