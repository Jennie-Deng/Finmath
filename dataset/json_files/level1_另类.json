        "explanation": "C is correct. A CLO manager will extend several loans to corporations (usually to\nfirms involved in LBOs, corporate acquisitions, or other similar types of transactions), pool\nthese loans, and then divide that pool into various tranches of debt and equity that range in\nseniority and security. The CLO manager will then sell each tranche to different investors\naccording to their risk profiles; the most senior portion of the CLO will be the least risky,\nand the most junior portion of the CLO (i.e., equity) will be the riskiest. A is incorrect\nbecause with the different CLO tranches having distinct risks varying with their seniority and\nsecurity, they will be priced over a range of interest rates. In contrast, unitranche debt\ncombines different tranches of secured and unsecured debt into a single loan with a single,\nblended interest rate.B is incorrect because debt extended to niche borrowers in specific\nsituations is more commonly offered through specialty loans. For example, in litigation\nfinance, a specialist funding company provides debt to a client to finance the borrower\u2019s\nlegal fees and expenses in exchange for a portion of any case winnings. \uff1aC\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002CLO\u7ecf\u7406\u5c06\n\u5411\u516c\u53f8\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u53c2\u4e0e\u6760\u6746\u6536\u8d2d\u3001\u516c\u53f8\u6536\u8d2d\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u516c\u53f8\uff09\u53d1\u653e\u51e0\u7b14\u8d37\u6b3e\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d37\u6b3e\u96c6\u4e2d\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u7136\n\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d37\u6b3e\u5206\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u503a\u52a1\u548c\u80a1\u6743\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u503a\u52a1\u548c\u80a1\u6743\u5728\u7b49\u7ea7\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0cCLO\u7ecf\u7406\u5c06\u6839\u636e\n\u4e0d\u540c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u51fa\u552e\u7ed9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\uff1bCLO\u4e2d\u6700\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u6700\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u5373\n\u80a1\u6743\uff09\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u9ad8\u3002A\u662f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684CLO\u4efd\u989d\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5176\u8d44\u5386\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5c06\n\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5229\u7387\u4e0a\u5b9a\u4ef7\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0cunitranche\u503a\u52a1\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6709\u62c5\u4fdd\u548c\u65e0\u62c5\u4fdd\u503a\u52a1\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u5355\u4e00\u8d37\u6b3e\uff0c\u5229\u7387\u4e3a\u5355\n\u4e00\u6df7\u5408\u5229\u7387\u3002B\u662f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5ef6\u4f38\u5230\u5229\u57fa\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u7684\u503a\u52a1\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u4e1a\u8d37\u6b3e\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728\n\u8bc9\u8bbc\u878d\u8d44\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e13\u4e1a\u878d\u8d44\u516c\u53f8\u5411\u5ba2\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u503a\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8d39\u7528\u548c\u5f00\u652f\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d44\u91d1\uff0c\u4ee5\u6362\u53d6\u4efb\u4f55\u6848\u4ef6\u8d62\u6b3e\u7684\n\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002",

Prepayments will likely increase when\ninterest rates decline, because borrowers are likely to refinance their loans at a faster pace.\n\uff1aC\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\u5f53\u5229\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u65f6\uff0c\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u66f4\u5feb\u5f97\u8fdb\u884c\u518d\u878d\u8d44\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4MBS\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u644a\u9500\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u4e86\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\n\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5c42\u3002A\u662f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u538c\u6076\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u4fdd\u9669\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u66f4\u559c\u6b22\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\n\u90e8\u5206\u9996\u5148\u83b7\u5f97\u5229\u606f\u548c\u672c\u91d1\u3002\u6700\u6b21\u8981\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u79f0\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u635f\u5931\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u83b7\u5f97\u5229\u606f\n\u548c\u672c\u91d1\u5206\u914d\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002B\u662f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5f53\u5229\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\u65f6\uff0c\u9884\u4ed8\u6b3e\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u653e\u7f13\uff0c\u5ef6\u957f\u5927\u591a\u6570MBS\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u671f\u9650\u3002\u5f53\n\u5229\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u65f6\uff0c\u9884\u4ed8\u6b3e\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4ee5\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a\u8d37\u6b3e\u518d\u878d\u8d44\u3002",

The determination of an IRR involves certain assumptions about a\nfinancing rate to use for outgoing cash flows (typically a weighted average cost of capital)\nand a reinvestment rate assumption to make on incoming cash flows (which must be assumed and\nmay or may not actually be earned).A is incorrect because the money multiple calculation\ncompletely ignores the timing of cash flows.C is incorrect because it is somewhat of a reversal\nof cause and effect: Private equity (PE) funds can appear to have low volatility because of the\nlag in their mark-to-market process. It\u2019s not that PE investments don\u2019t actually rise and\nfall behind the scenes with economic influences, but accounting conventions may simply leave\nlonger-lived investments marked at their initial cost for some time or with only modest\nadjustments to such carrying value until known impairments or realization events begin to\ntranspire. Also, because PE funds are not easily marked to market, their returns can appear\nsomewhat smoothed, making them appear more resilient and less correlated with other assets than\nthey really are.

The owner can use property non-cash depreciation expenses to reduce taxable income and\nlower the current income tax bill. In fact, accelerated depreciation and interest expense can\nreduce taxable income below zero in the early years of asset ownership, and losses can be\ncarried forward to offset future income. Thus, a property investment can be cash-flow positive\nwhile generating accounting losses and deferring tax payments. If the tax losses do not reverse\nduring the life of the asset, depreciation-recapture taxes can be triggered when the property\nis sold.

        "question_text": "An investor in a private equity fund is concerned that the general partner can receive\nincentive fees in excess of the agreed-on incentive fees by making distributions over time\nbased on profits earned rather than making distributions only at exit from investments of the\nfund. Which of the following is most likey to protect the investor from the general partner\nreceiving excess fees?",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "B is correct. A clawback provision requires the general partner in a private equity\nfund to return any funds distributed (to the general partner) as incentive fees until the\nlimited partners have received back their initial investments and the contracted portion of the\ntotal profits. A high hurdle rate will result in distributions occurring only after the fund\nachieves a specified return. A high hurdle rate decreases the likelihood of, but does not\nprevent, excess distributions. Management fees, not incentive fees, are based on committed\ncapital. \uff1a B\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\u8ffd\u56de\u6761\u6b3e\u8981\u6c42\u79c1\u52df\u80a1\u6743\u57fa\u91d1\u7684\u666e\u901a\u5408\u4f19\u4eba\u5c06\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u666e\u901a\u5408\u4f19\u4eba\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u8d39\u8fd4\u8fd8\uff0c\u76f4\u81f3\n\u6709\u9650\u5408\u4f19\u4eba\u6536\u56de\u521d\u59cb\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u5408\u540c\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u603b\u5229\u6da6\u3002\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u57fa\u91d1\u83b7\u5f97\u7279\u5b9a\u56de\u62a5\u540e\u624d\u8fdb\u884c\n\u5206\u914d\u3002\u9ad8\u95e8\u69db\u7387\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u989d\u5206\u914d\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u4f1a\u963b\u6b62\u8d85\u989d\u5206\u914d\u3002C\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u7ba1\u7406\u8d39\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6fc0\u52b1\u8d39\uff0c\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u627f\u8bfa\n\u8d44\u672c\u7684\u3002",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "B is correct. The Sharpe ratio assumes normally distributed returns. However,\nalternative assets tend to have non-normal return distributions with significant skewness (fat\ntails in one direction or the other) and kurtosis (sharper peak than a normal distribution has,\nwith fatter tails). Therefore, the Sharpe ratio may not be a good risk-adjusted performance\nmeasure to rely on for alternative investments.A is incorrect because the Sharpe ratio does not\nuse a semi-deviation measure of volatility; it uses standard deviation. The Sortino ratio uses\na semi-deviation measure of volatility. Further, the use of semi-deviation instead of standard\ndeviation actually makes the Sortino ratio a more attractive measure of alternative asset\nperformance than the Sharpe ratio. C is incorrect because correlation does not enter into the\ncalculation of the Sharpe ratio. However, it is true that alternative assets can have low\ncorrelations with other asset classes. In contrast to the Sharpe ratio, the Treynor ratio\nincorporates the beta of the alternative asset relative to a benchmark, which is conceptually\nsimilar to correlation.\uff1aB\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u5047\u8bbe\u6536\u76ca\u4e3a\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u8d44\u4ea7\u5f80\u5f80\u5177\u6709\u975e\u6b63\u6001\u6536\n\u76ca\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u504f\u5ea6\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\u6216\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u539a\u5c3e\uff09\u548c\u5cf0\u5ea6\uff08\u5c16\u5cf0\u6bd4\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u5c16\u9510\uff0c\u5c3e\u5df4\u66f4\u539a\uff09\u3002\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u66ff\u4ee3\u6295\u8d44\u6240\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7ecf\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u826f\u597d\u4e1a\u7ee9\u6307\u6807\u3002A\u662f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u6ca1\u6709\u4f7f\n\u7528\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u534a\u504f\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u3002\u7d22\u8482\u8bfa\u6bd4\u7387\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u534a\u504f\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u534a\u504f\u5dee\u4ee3\u66ff\u6807\u51c6\n\u504f\u5dee\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7d22\u8482\u8bfa\u6bd4\u7387\u6210\u4e3a\u6bd4\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u66f4\u5177\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ee9\u6548\u8861\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002C\u662f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6ca1\n\u6709\u8fdb\u5165\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u8d44\u4ea7\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u8d44\u4ea7\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f88\u4f4e\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002\u4e0e\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u7279\u96f7\n\u8bfa\u6bd4\u7387\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u66ff\u4ee3\u8d44\u4ea7\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u8d1d\u5854\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002",
