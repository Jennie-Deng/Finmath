            "Kalila Al-Khalili has been hired as a consultant to a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth\nfund. The fund’s oversight committee has asked her to examine the fund’s financial\ncharacteristics and recommend an appropriate currency management strategy given the fund’s\nInvestment Policy Statement. After a thorough study of the fund and its finances, Al-Khalili\nreaches the following conclusions:The fund’s mandate is focused on the long-term development\nof the country, and the royal family (who are very influential on the fund’s oversight\ncommittee) are prepared to take a long-term perspective on the fund’s investments. The fund’s\nstrategic asset allocation is tilted towards equity rather than fixed-income assets.The fund’s\nstrategic asset allocation is tilted towards equity rather than fixed-income assets.Both its\nfixed-income and equity portfolios have a sizeable exposure to emerging market\nassets.Currently, about 90% of exchange rate exposures are hedged although the IPS allows a\nrange of hedge ratios.Liquidity needs of the fund are minimal, since the government is running\na balanced budget and is unlikely to need to dip into the fund in the near term to cover fiscal\ndeficits. Indeed, the expected lifetime of country’s large oil reserves has been greatly\nextended by recent discoveries, and substantial oil royalties are expected to persist into the\nfuture.\n "

Applying this bias involves buying currencies selling at a\nforward discount and selling currencies trading at a forward premium. So a higher forward\npremium on the lower yielding currency—the USD, the base currency in the INR/USD quote—would\neffectively reflect a more profitable trading opportunity. That is, a higher premium for buying\nor selling the USD forward is associated with a lower US interest rate compared to India. This\nwould mean a wider interest rate differential in favor of Indian instruments, and hence\npotentially more carry trade profits.\nA is incorrect because Subscriber 3’s carry trade strategy depends on a wide interest rate\ndifferential between the high-yield country (India) and the low-yield country (the United\nStates). The differential should be wide enough to compensate for the unhedged currency risk\nexposure.C is incorrect because a guide to the carry trade’s riskiness is the volatility of\nspot rates on the involved currencies, with rapid movements in exchange rates often associated\nwith a panicked unwinding of carry trades.

This\ncan lead to higher holding returns, but these higher returns can also come with higher risks:\ncarry trades are occasionally subject to panicked unwinds in stressed market conditions. When\nthis occurs, position exit can be made more difficult by market illiquidity and higher trading\ncosts (wider bid/offer spreads). The leverage involved in the carry trade can magnify trading\nlosses under these circumstances.\nA is incorrect because return distributions are often negatively skewed, reflecting the higher\nevent risk (panicked carry trade unwinds, currency pegs being re-set, etc.) associated with the\ncarry trade.B is incorrect because although FX markets are typically efficient (or very close\nthereto) this does not mean that higher returns are not available. The key question is whether\nthese are abnormally high risk-adjusted returns. Higher return in an efficient market comes\nwith higher risk.

Mathematically, the\ndomestic-currency return is expressed as: RDC = (1 + RFC)(1 + RFX) – 1where RDC is the\ndomestic-currency return (in percent), RFC is the foreign-currency return, and RFX is the\npercentage change of the foreign currency against the domestic currency. Note that this RFX\nexpression is calculated using the investor’s domestic currency (the EUR in this case) as the\nprice currency in the P/B quote. This is different than the market-standard currency quotes in\nExhibit 1, where the EUR is the base currency in each of these quotes. Therefore, for the\nforeign currency (USD, GBP, or CHF) to appreciate against the EUR, the market-standard quote\n(USD/EUR, GBP/EUR, or CHF/EUR, respectively) must decrease; i.e. the EUR must depreciate.The\nEuro-Swiss (CHF/EUR) is the only spot rate with a negative change (from 1.2175 to 1.2080),\nmeaning the EUR depreciated against the CHF (the CHF/EUR rate decreased). Or put differently,\nthe CHF appreciated against the EUR, adding to the EUR-denominated return for the German\ninvestor holding CHF-denominated assets. This would result in a higher domestic-currency return\n(RDC), for the German investor, relative to the foreign-currency return (RFC) for the CHF-\ndenominated assets. Both the Euro-dollar (USD/EUR) and Euro-sterling (GBP/EUR) experienced a\npositive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against these two currencies (the\nUSD/EUR rate and the GBP/EUR rate both increased). This would result in a lower domestic-\ncurrency return (RDC) for the German investor relative to the foreign-currency return (RFC) for\nthe USD- and GBP-denominated assets.A is incorrect because the Euro-dollar (USD/EUR)\nexperienced a positive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against the USD\n(the USD/EUR rate increased). This would result in a lower domestic-currency (i.e. EUR-\ndenominated) return relative to the foreign-currency return for the USD-denominated assets,\nsince the USD has depreciated against the EUR.B is incorrect because the Euro-sterling\n(GBP/EUR) experienced a positive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against\nthe GPB (the GBP/EUR rate increased).

        "explanation": "Braunt Pensionskasse provides the manager with limited discretion in managing the\nportfolio’s currency risk exposures.This would be most consistent with allowing the currency\noverlay manager to take directional views on future currency movements (within predefined\nbounds) where the currency overlay is limited to the currency exposures already in the foreign\nasset portfolio. It would not be appropriate to use a fully-passive hedging approach since it\nwould eliminate any alpha from currency movements. Further, a currency overlay program, which\nconsiders “foreign exchange as an asset class”, would likely expose Braunt’s portfolio to\nmore currency risk than desired given the given primary performance objectives.A is incorrect\nbecause a directional view currency overlay program is most appropriate given the limited\ndiscretion Braunt Pensionskasse has given the manager.A fully passive currency overlay program\nis more likely to be used when a client seeks to hedge all the currency risk.C is incorrect\nbecause a directional view currency overlay program is most appropriate given the limited\ndiscretion Braunt Pensionskasse has given the manager. In contrast, the concept of “foreign\nexchange as an asset class” allows the currency overlay manager to take currency exposure\npositions in any currency pair where there is value-added to be harvested.",
