One method\nthat can be used to address the potential for negative interest rates when constructing\ninterest rate trees is to set all negative interest rates to zero. This localizes the change in\nassumptions to points in the distribution corresponding to negative interest rates and\npreserves the original rate tree for all other observations. In comparison, adjusting the risk\nneutral probabilities would alter the dynamics across the entire range of interest rates and\ntherefore not be an optimal approach.When a model displays the potential for negative short-\nterm interest rates, it can still be a desirable model to use in certain situations, especially\nin cases where the valuation depends more on the average path of the interest rate, such as in\nvaluing coupon bonds.

When a model displays the potential for negative short-\nterm interest rates, it can still be a desirable model to use in certain situations, especially\nin cases where the valuation depends more on the average path of the interest rate, such as in\nvaluing coupon bonds.
