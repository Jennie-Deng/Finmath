        "explanation": "英文：B is correct. Company Z’s return on equity based on year-end equity value\nwill be 6.1%. Company Z will have an additional ￡200,000 of expenses compared with Company X.\nCompany Z expensed the printer for ￡300,000 rather than capitalizing the printer and having a\ndepreciation expense of ￡100,000 like Company X. Company Z’s net income and shareholders’\nequity will be ￡150,000 lower (= ￡200,000 × 0.75) than that of Company X.\n 这道题目当中，他说X和Z这两个公司所有的信息都是一样的，只不过X公司对于一个30万的打印机费用采取\n了资本化，三年折旧，而Z公司采取了费用化。这里给了我们X公司相关的一些信息，然后让我们计算Z公司的\n权益回报率。 根据题目信息，X公司的净利润是750000，对于打印机的费用选择了资本化，而且是三年直线\n折旧。那这个时候相当于它记录在利润表当中的费用是10万的折旧费用。而Z公司将这笔费用进行了费用化\n，所以这个时候及公司他确认的费用是30万。因此X公司的税前利润会比Z公司的税前利润高20万，而税后的\n净利润只高了15万（20*0.75）。那这个时候Z公司的净利润=750000-150000=600000 而X公司期末的所有者权\n益时是10 million，同时这10million当中包含了当期X公司当期记录的净利润75万。因此计算Z公司所有者权\n益的时候，需要将当年净利润的差异做一个调整，也就是将X公司的10million的所有者权益调减15万，得到\n985万。 因此最终计算出来的股东回报率=600000/9850000=6.1%，选择B选项。",
