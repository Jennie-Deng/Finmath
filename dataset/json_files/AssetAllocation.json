Thus, higher-risk assets should have a wider corridor to avoid frequent,\ncostly rebalancing costs. Her other suggestions are not correct. Less-liquid asset classes\nshould have a wider, not narrower, corridor width. Less-liquid assets should have a wider\ncorridor to avoid frequent rebalancing costs. For taxable investors, transactions trigger\ncapital gains in jurisdictions that tax them. For such investors, higher tax rates on capital\ngains should be associated with wider (not narrower) corridor widths.",

Twenty percent of the Martins’ $600,000 in financial assets is held in cash and\nearmarked for funding their daughter Lara’s university studies, which begin in one year.\nLara’s education and their own retirement are the Martins’ highest-priority goals.

For baseline retirement needs, Quinn\nrecommends that the Martins maintain their current overall 60% equity/40% bonds (± 8%\nrebalancing range) strategic asset allocation. Quinn calculates that given current financial\nassets and expected future earnings, the Martins could reduce future retirement savings by 15%\nand still comfortably retire at 62. The Martins wish to allocate that 15% to a sub-portfolio\nwith the goal of making a charitable gift to their alma mater from their estate. Although the\ngift is a low-priority goal, the Martins want the sub-portfolio to earn the highest return\npossible.

Their\ninterest income is taxed at 35%, and capital gains and dividends are taxed at 20%. The Martins\nwant to minimize taxes. Based on personal research, Neal makes the following two\nstatements:Statement 1: The after-tax return volatility of assets held in taxable accounts will\nbe less than the pre-tax return volatility.Statement 2: Assets that receive more favorable tax\ntreatment should be held in tax-deferred accounts.The equity portion of the Martins’\nportfolios produced an annualized return of 20% for the past three years. As a result, the\nMartins’ equity allocation in both their taxable and tax-deferred portfolios has increased to\n71%, with bonds falling to 29%.

McCall suggests to Snead that the KCPF might benefit from an\nupdated IPS. Following a thorough review, McCall recommends a new IPS and strategic asset\nallocation.The proposed IPS revisions include a plan for short-term deviations from strategic\nasset allocation targets.
