The P/E\nratio will not necessarily remain the same following the merger and is more likely to decline.\nThe pre-merger P/E for Modern Auto is 40/2.50 = 16. After the merger, the EPS would be $130\nmillion/49.375 million shares, or 2.6329. The post-merger P/E will probably fall to 40/2.6329 =\n15.19.",

Hernández estimates that this project will\nincrease the value of the company and, consequently, she plans on changing her research opinion\non the company from a “hold” to a “buy.” Her initial financial predictions for the project\nare:● Fixed capital equipment outlay is €2,750,000.● At the beginning of the project, a\nrequired increase in current assets of €200,000 and a required increase in current liabilities\nof €125,000.● Straight-line depreciation to zero over a five-year life.● Project life of\nfive years.● Incremental annual unit sales of 3,000 at a unit price of €600.● Annual fixed\ncash expenses of €125,000; variable cash expenses of €125 per unit.● The capital equipment\nis expected to be sold for €450,000 at the end of Year 5. At the end of the project, the net\nworking capital investment will be recovered.● Tax rate of 40 percent.● Based on the capital\nasset pricing model, the required rate of return is 12 percent.Hernández estimates the expected\nnet present value (NPV) of the project to be €975,538 and the internal rate of return (IRR) to\nbe 24.6 percent. She also performs a sensitivity analysis by changing the input variable\nassumptions used in her initial analysis.When reviewing Hernández's work, her supervisor,\nArturo Costa, notes that she did not include changes in the depreciation method, initial fixed\ncapital outlay, or inflation assumptions in her sensitivity analysis. As a result, Costa asks\nthe following questions:Question 1“What would be the effect on the project's NPV if the\ninitial fixed capital equipment outlay increased from €2,750,000 to €3,000,000, everything\nelse held constant?”Question 2“How would a higher than expected inflation rate affect the\nvalue of the real tax savings from depreciation and the value of the real after-tax interest\nexpense, everything else held constant?”Question 3“You are using a required rate of return of\n12 percent when the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 10 percent. Why are\nyou using a required rate of return for the project greater than the company's WACC?”Before\nending the meeting, Costa tells Hernández: “Last year the company produced a prototype at a\ncost of €500,000. Now management is having doubts about the market appeal of the product in\nits current design, and so they are considering delaying the start of the project for a year,\nuntil the prototype can be shown to industry experts.”\n "

Lee's first comment is “Moonbase can institute a poison pill that allows our\nshareholders, other than the hostile bidder, to purchase shares at a substantial discount to\ncurrent market value.” Lee's second comment is: “Moonbase can instead institute a poison put.\nThe put allows shareholders the opportunity to redeem their shares at a substantial premium to\ncurrent market value.”Zin is also concerned about the general attitude of outside investors\nwith the governance of Moonbase. He has read brokerage reports indicating that the Moonbase\ngovernance ratings are generally low.

To assess the\nvalue of their own firm, they are reviewing current financial data for Jupiter PLC, Saturn\nCorporation, and Voyager Corporation, three firms they believe are comparable to Moonbase.\nZin believes Moonbase should trade at similar multiples to these firms and that each valuation\nratio measure is equally valid. Moonbase has a current stock price of $34.00 per share,\nearnings of $1.75 per share, book value of $8.50 per share, and cash flow of $3.20 per share.\nUsing the average of each of the three multiples for the three comparable firms, Zin finds that\nMoonbase is undervalued.Lee states that the low valuation reflects current poor performance of\na subsidiary of Moonbase. She recommends that the board of directors consider divesting the\nsubsidiary in a manner that would provide cash inflow to Moonbase.Zin proposes that some action\nshould be taken before a hostile takeover bid is made. He asks Lee if changes can be made to\nthe corporate governance structure in order to make it more difficult for an unwanted suitor to\nsucceed.In response, Lee makes two comments of actions that would make a hostile takeover more\ndifficult. Lee's first comment is “Moonbase can institute a poison pill that allows our\nshareholders, other than the hostile bidder, to purchase shares at a substantial discount to\ncurrent market value.” Lee's second comment is: “Moonbase can instead institute a poison put.\nThe put allows shareholders the opportunity to redeem their shares at a substantial premium to\ncurrent market value.”Zin is also concerned about the general attitude of outside investors\nwith the governance of Moonbase. He has read brokerage reports indicating that the Moonbase\ngovernance ratings are generally low. Zin believes the following statements describe\ncharacteristics that should provide Moonbase with a strong governance rating.Statement 1:\nMoonbase's directors obtain advice from the corporate counsel to aid them in assessing the\nfirm's compliance with regulatory requirements.Statement 2: Five of the ten members of the\nboard of directors are not employed by Moonbase and are considered independent. Though not\nemployed by the company, two of the independent directors are former executives of the company\nand thus can contribute useful expertise relevant for the business.Statement 3: The audit\ncommittee of the board is organized so as to have sufficient resources to carry out its task,\nwith an internal staff that reports routinely and directly to the audit committee.Zin is\nparticularly proud of the fact that Moonbase has begun drafting a “Statement of Corporate\nGovernance” (SCG) that will be available on the company website for viewing by shareholders,\ninvestment analysts, and any interested stakeholders. In particular, the SCG pays special\nattention to policies that ensure effective contributions from the board of directors. These\npolicies include the following:Policy 1: Training is provided to directors prior to joining the\nboard and periodically thereafter.Policy 2: Statements are provided of management's assessment\nof the board's performance of its fiduciary responsibilities.Policy 3: Statements are provided\nof directors' responsibilities regarding oversight and monitoring of the firm's risk management\nand compliance functions.Zin concludes the discussion by announcing that Johann Steris, a\nhighly regarded ex-CFO of a major corporation, is under consideration as a member of an\nexpanded board of directors. Zin states that Steris meets all the requirements as an\nindependent director including the fact that he will not violate the interlocking directorship\nrequirement. Steris also will bring experience as a member of the compensation committee of the\nboard of another firm. He also comments that Steris desires to serve on either the audit or\ncompensation committee of the Moonbase board and that good governance practice suggests that\nSteris would not be prohibited from serving on either committee.\n "

Lynbrock should decrease the discount rate given that EnileGEN should have a\ncompetitive edge over its competitors due to the new environmental regulation.\nA is incorrect because Lynbrock is estimating the expected effect of the new environmental\nregulation on EnileGEN’s stock, not bond, value. Additionally, to justify a credit spread\nincrease, the risk for a company would have to increase. Instead, the anticipated environmental\nregulation should give EnileGEN a competitive edge, thereby reducing risk.\nC is incorrect because the new environmental regulation should not impact EnileGEN’s operating\ncosts.

        "explanation": "Statement 3 is correct because one unique risk of green bonds is greenwashing,\nwhich is the risk that the bond’s proceeds are not actually used for a beneficial\nenvironmental or climate-related project. Greenwashing can result in an investor overpaying for\na bond (if the investor paid a premium for the bond’s green feature) or holding a bond that\ndoes not satisfy a prescribed environmental or climate investment mandate.\nA is incorrect because Statement 1 is incorrect. Green bonds are typically similar to an\nissuer’s conventional bonds, with the exception that the bond proceeds are earmarked for green\nprojects. Green bonds normally have the same credit ratings and bondholder recourse as\nconventional bonds of the same issuer (all else being equal).\nB is incorrect because Statement 2 is incorrect. It is true that some green bonds command a\npremium, or tighter credit spread, versus comparable conventional bonds because of high market\ndemand. This would reduce a company’s cost of capital. However, issuing green bonds does not\nalways ensure a lower cost of capital for a company because green bonds are typically similar\nto an issuer’s conventional bonds. Green bonds normally have the same credit ratings and\nbondholder recourse as conventional bonds of the same issuer. Furthermore, green bonds may be\nless liquid than conventional bonds, such that they don’t command a premium from investors.\nGreen bonds also have higher reporting and monitoring costs than conventional bonds, thus\npotentially resulting in higher costs for the issuer.",

            "Josh Logan is a buy-side equity analyst who follows Durtech. Logan's supervisor\nbelieves that Durtech is a likely takeover candidate and has asked Logan to estimate the\ncompany's value per share in the event of an “all stock” takeover bid. Logan plans to\nestimate Durtech's value per share using three approaches: discounted cash flow, comparable\ncompany analysis, and comparable transaction analysis.Durtech has 1.2 million common shares\noutstanding and no outstanding long-term debt or preferred stock. Logan estimates that\nDurtech's free cash flows at the end of the next three years will be $5.0 million, $6.0\nmillion, and $7.0 million, respectively. After Year 3, he projects that free cash flow will\ngrow at 5 percent per year. He determines the appropriate discount rate for this free cash flow\nstream is 15 percent per year.\nApplying discounted cash flow analysis to the preceding information, Logan determines that\nDurtech’s fair enterprise value is $61.8 million. In a separate analysis based on ratios,\nLogan estimates that at the end of the third year, Durtech will be worth 10 times its Year 3\nfree cash flow.Logan gathers data on two companies comparable to Durtech: Alphatech and\nBetatech. He believes that price-to-earnings, price-to-sales, and price-to-book-value per share\nof these companies should be used to value Durtech. The relevant data for the three companies\nare given in Exhibit 1.\nLogan also identifies one recent takeover transaction and analyzes its takeover premium (the\namount by which its takeover price per share exceeds its current stock price). Omegatech is\ncomparable to the possible transaction on Durtech. Omegatech had a stock price of $44.40 per\nshare prior to a newspaper report of a takeover rumor. After the takeover rumor was reported,\nthe price rose immediately to $60.30 per share. Eventually, the takeover offer was accepted by\nOmegatech's shareholders for $55.00 per share. One-year trailing earnings per share for\nOmegatech immediately prior to the takeover were $1.25 per share.\n "

Richie Express will sell the asset in three years, paying\n30 percent taxes on any excess of the selling price over book value. The proposal indicates\nthat a $647,500 terminal selling price will enable the company to earn a 15 percent internal\nrate of return on the investment. Bohm doubts that this terminal value estimate is\ncorrect.Another proposal concerns Gasup Company, which does natural gas exploration. A new\ninvestment has been identified by the Gasup finance department with the following projected\ncash flows:● Investment outlays are $6 million immediately and $1 million at the end of the\nfirst year.● After-tax operating cash flows are $0.5 million at the end of the first year and\n$4 million at the end of each of the second, third, fourth, and fifth years. In addition, an\nafter-tax outflow occurs at the end of the five-year project that has not been included in the\noperating cash flows: $5 million required for environmental cleanup.● The required rate of\nreturn on natural gas exploration is 18 percent.The Gasup analyst is unsure about the\ncalculation of the NPV and the IRR because the outlay is staged over two years.Finally,\nDominion Company is evaluating two mutually exclusive projects: The Pinto grinder involves an\noutlay of $100,000, annual after-tax operating cash flows of $45,000, an after-tax salvage\nvalue of $25,000, and a three-year life. The Bolten grinder has an outlay of $125,000, annual\nafter-tax operating cash flows of $47,000, an after-tax salvage value of $20,000, and a four-\nyear life.
