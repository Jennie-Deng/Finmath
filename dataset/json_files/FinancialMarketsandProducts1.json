        "explanation": "OTC derivatives include the following five broad classes of derivative securities:\ninterest rate derivatives, foreign exchange derivatives, equity derivatives, commodity\nderivatives and credit derivatives. Interest rate products contribute the majority of the\noutstanding notional, with foreign exchange and credit default swaps seemingly less important.\nHowever, this gives a somewhat misleading view of the importance of counterparty risk in other\nasset classes, especially foreign exchange and credit default swaps. Whilst most foreign\nexchange products are short-dated, the long-dated nature and exchange of notional in cross-\ncurrency swaps means they carry a lot of counterparty risk. Credit default swaps not only have\na large volatility component but also constitute significant ‘wrong-way risk’. Therefore,\nwhilst interest rate products make up a significant proportion of the counterparty risk in the\nmarket, one must not underestimate the other important (and sometimes more subtle)\ncontributions from other products.场外衍生工具包括以下五大类衍生证券：利率衍生工具、外汇衍生工\n具、股票衍生工具、商品衍生工具和信用衍生工具。利率产品规模较大，而外汇和信用违约互换似乎不那么\n重要。然而，这在一定程度上误导了人们对其它资产类别(尤其是外汇和信用违约互换)交易对手风险重要性\n的看法。虽然大多数外汇产品都是短期的，但长期的性质和在跨货币互换中的名义汇率意味着它们会带来大\n量的交易对手风险。信用违约互换不仅具有很大的波动性，而且构成了重大的“错误风险”。因此，虽然利\n率产品在市场交易对手风险中占相当大的比例，但不能低估其他产品的其他重要(有时更微妙)贡献。",

Corn is produced in the fall of every year, but it is consumed throughout the year. Natural gas is an example of a commodity with constant production but seasonal demand. Natural gas is expensive to store, and demand in the United States peaks during high periods of use in the winter months. In addition the price of natural gas is different for various regions due to high international transportation costs. The demand and production of oil is more constant relative to natural gas due to the ability to transport and store oil more cheaply than natural gas. Therefore, the worldwide demand and production is relatively more constant even though it is subject to supply and demand stocks.\n\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nCommodities & Oil & Corn & Natural Gas \\\\\n\\hline\nProduction & Constant & Seasonal & Constant \\\\\n\\hline\nDemand & Relatively constant & Constant & Seasonal \\\\\n\\hline\nStorage Costs & Relatively moderate & Moderate & Expensive \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}",

None of these are subjective. In the case of an indemnity trigger, basis risk is low.\n衍生产品市场已经出现了若干种不同的产品可以用来对冲灾难风险，最为流行的产品是巨灾债券（CAT\nbond）。这些债券通常由保险公司的子公司发行，其券息比一般债券要高。为了收人高券息，债券的持有者\n必须在某种类型的灾难事件发生时承担损失。根据CAT债券条款的不同，债券的券息以及本金（或者两者）都\n可能被用来支付保险索赔。 巨灾债券的特性是其投资人有很高的概率获取高券息，而蒙受高损失的概率比较\n低。为什么有投资者对这类产品感兴趣呢？原因在于类似长寿债券，巨灾债券风险与市场风险之间没有统计\n上的强相关性，正因为如此，对投资人来说，巨灾债券往往是一个可以添加到投资组合中的具有吸引力的选\n择。因为这些债券没有系统性风险，它们的整体风险完全可以在一个大的交易组合中被得以分散。",
