After the interview, the department manager replied that\nJack lacked the basic knowledge of fixed-income securities. Jack recalled the conversation and\nfound some of the following statements he said might be wrong.Statement 1: Debenture bonds have\nless risks than collateral trust bonds, since only high-rating companies can issue debenture\nbonds. Statement 2: Guaranteed bonds rank undoubtedly above collateral trust bonds, because\ncollaterals may devaluate as time passes, while guarantor is almost sure to pay for the debts\nif the guarantee fails to pay.Statement 3: Bonds issued by highly creditworthy firms generally\ncontain few covenants.Statement 4: Call provisions benefit bond issuers, while put provisions\nbenefit bondholders.Which of these statement（　） is (are) wrong?",

        "explanation": "本题的考点为不同抵押类型债券的性质辨析。Statement 1: collateral trust bonds （抵押\n信托债券）是有金融资产作为抵押品的债券，当发生违约时，可以对抵押品进行清算从而获得违约的补偿。\n与 collateral trust bonds（担保信托债券）不同，Debenture bonds（无抵押债券）是没有抵押品的，因\n此面临的风险是高于抵押信托债券的。Statement 1是错误的。Statement 2: guaranteed bonds（担保债券\n）的担保效果和债券发行人与担保人之间的财务相关性息息相关，因为如果债券发行人和担保人之间的财务\n相关性比较大，那么发行人发生违约的时候，担保人的财务状况也表现很差，那么有可能这个时候担保人也\n没有能力履行担保职责从而偿付款项。反之，相关性越小担保效果越好。不能简单一味地认为提供担保的第\n三方就有能力履行担保职责。Statement 2是错误的。Statement 3: 债券契约中会有三类条款，规定发行人\n必须做到的积极条款（positive covenants），禁止某些行为的消极条款（negative covenants），还有维\n持财务指标的财务条款（financial covenants），一个公司信用质量越好，契约中所含的条款就会越少。\nStatement 3 是正确的。Statement 4: Call provisions（赎回条款）允许发行人在一定时间以一定价格赎\n回债券，这对发行人有利；而put provisions（回售条款）则让债券持有人有权在特定日期以预先确定的价\n格将债券卖回给发行人，这对债券持有人有利。Statement 4是正确的。因此，选项B正确。",

        "explanation": "本题的考点为操作风险的度量模型的辨析。如果使用BIA模型，在没有出现毛利润为负的情况下\n，过去三年的平均毛利润乘以15%可以计算出资本的数额。在2018年: 毛利润= 380 + 712 + 846 = USD 1938\nbillion。类似的，2017、2016年的毛利润分别为USD 1766 billion、USD 1612 billion。近三年的平均毛利\n润为 USD 1,772 billion。操作风险资本要求为1,772×15% =USD 265.8 billion. 因此I正确。如果使用\nSA模型，不同的业务条线的毛利润所乘的比例不同。零售银行业务、商业银行业务和销售交易的比例分别为\n12%、15%以及18%。2018: 0.12×380+0.15×712+0.18×846 = USD 304.68 billion2017:\n0.12×344+0.15×645+0.18×777 = USD 277.89 billion2016: 0.12×326+0.15×599+0.18×687 = USD\n252.63 billion操作风险资本的要求为:(304.68+277.89+252.63) / 3 = USD 278.4 billion。 SA模型计算\n出的结果要比BIA模型所计算的结果要更大。 因此II错误。如果使用AMA模型计算操作风险资本，需要对损失\n的发生频率和损失的严重程度进行建模，从而生成损失的分布。因此III正确。",

        "explanation": "Answer: C：本题考点为压力测试（stress testing）的原理和压力测试的关键要素。对于选项\nA，压力测试是一种评估极端市场情形对银行影响的方法，该方法通过估计金融机构面临极端情景的表现，从\n而判断其是否有充足的资本金和流动性资产以抵御这些极端市场情形。所以，该选项描述正确，不符合题意\n，为错误选项。对于选项B，反向压力测试分析的是哪些极端情景导致了金融机构的失败。所以，该选项描述\n正确，不符合题意，为错误选项。对于选项C，极端事件往往会对银行系统产生严重的影响，虽然这些事件发\n生的可能性会很小。所以，该选项描述错误，符合题意，为正确选项。对于选项D，在压力测试的关键要素中\n，情景选择是关键的要素之一。情景选择第一步是确定一个合适的时间跨度。这个时间跨度要足够长，以评\n估情景的全面影响。常见的时间跨度为3个月到2年不等。有的可能会更长，长达几十年的时间跨度，例如一\n些养老金计划，或者保险公司。所以，该选项描述正确，不符合题意，为错误选项。因此，正确选项为C。",
