            "Cátia Pinho is a supervisor in the equity research division of Suite Securities. Pinho\nasks Flávia Silveira, a junior analyst, to complete an analysis of Adesivo S.A., Enviado S.A.,\nand Gesticular S.A.Pinho directs Silveira to use a valuation metric that would allow for a\nmeaningful ranking of relative value of the three companies’ shares. Exhibit 1 provides\nselected financial information for the three companies.\nSilveira reviews underlying trailing EPS for Adesivo. Adesivo has basic trailing EPS of\nBRL0.84. Silveira finds the following note in Adesivo’s financial statements:“On a per share\nbasis, Adesivo incurred in the last four quartersi. from a lawsuit, a non-recurring gain of\nBRL0.04; andii. from factory integration, a non-recurring cost of BRL0.03 and a recurring cost\nof BRL0.01 in increased depreciation.”Silveira notes that Adesivo is forecasted to pay\nsemiannual dividends of BRL0.24 next year. Silveira estimates five-year earnings growth rates\nfor the three companies, which are presented in Exhibit 2.\nPinho asks Silveira about the possible use of the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) in assessing the\nrelative value of the three companies.

            "Ryan Leigh is preparing a presentation that analyzes the valuation of the common stock\nof two companies under consideration as additions to his firm’s recommended list, Emerald\nCorporation and Holt Corporation. Leigh has prepared preliminary valuations of both companies\nusing an FCFE model and is also preparing a value estimate for Emerald using a dividend\ndiscount model. Holt’s 2019 and 2020 financial statements, contained in Exhibits 1 and 2, are\nprepared in accordance with US GAAP.\nLeigh presents his valuations of the common stock of Emerald and Holt to his supervisor, Alice\nSmith. Smith has the following questions and comments:1 “I estimate that Emerald’s long-term\nexpected dividend payout rate is 20% and its return on equity is 10% over the long term.”2\n“Why did you use an FCFE model to value Holt’s common stock? Can you use a DDM instead?”3\n“How did Holt’s FCFE for 2020 compare with its FCFF for the same year? I recommend you use an\nFCFF model to value Holt’s common stock instead of using an FCFE model because Holt has had a\nhistory of leverage changes in the past.”4 “In the last three years, about 5% of Holt’s\ngrowth in FCFE has come from decreases in inventory.”Leigh responds to each of Smith’s points\nas follows:1 “I will use your estimates and calculate Emerald’s long-term, sustainable\ndividend growth rate.”2 “There are two reasons why I used the FCFE model to value Holt’s\ncommon stock instead of using a DDM. The first reason is that Holt’s dividends have differed\nsignificantly from its capacity to pay dividends. The second reason is that Holt is a takeover\ntarget and once the company is taken over, the new owners will have discretion over the uses of\nfree cash flow.”3 “I will calculate Holt’s FCFF for 2020 and estimate the value of Holt’s\ncommon stock using an FCFF model.”4 “Holt is a growing company.

The company has a history of\npaying modest dividends relative to FCFE, has a stable capital structure, and is owned by a\ncontrolling investor.The team also considers the impact of Company A’s three non-cash\ntransactions in the most recent year on its FCFE, including the following:● Transaction 1: A\n$900 million loss on a sale of equipment● Transaction 2: An impairment of intangibles of $400\nmillion● Transaction 3: A $300 million reversal of a previously recorded restructuring\nchargeIn addition, Company A’s annual report indicates that the firm expects to incur\nadditional non-cash charges related to restructuring over the next few years.To value the three\ncompanies’ shares, one team member suggests valuing the companies’ shares using net income as\na proxy for FCFE. Another team member proposes forecasting FCFE using a sales-based methodology\nbased on the following equation:FCFE = NI – (1 – DR)(FCInv – Dep) – (1 – DR)(WCInv)Izzo’s\nteam ultimately decides to use actual free cash flow to value the three companies’ shares.\nSelected data and assumptions are provided in Exhibit 2.\nThe team calculates the intrinsic value of Company B using a two-stage FCFE model. FCFE growth\nrates for the first four years are estimated at 10%, 9%, 8%, and 7%, respectively, before\ndeclining to a constant 6% starting in the fifth year.To calculate the intrinsic value of\nCompany C’s equity, the team uses the FCFF approach assuming a single-stage model where FCFF\nis expected to grow at 5% indefinitely.\n "
