            "Samuel Telline, CFA, is a portfolio manager at Aiklin Investments with discretionary\nauthority over all of his accounts. One of his clients, Alan Caper, Chief Executive Officer\n(CEO) of Ellipse Manufacturing, invites Telline to lunch.At the restaurant, the CEO reveals the\nreason for the lunch. “As you know Reinhold Partners has made an unsolicited cash offer for\nall outstanding shares of Ellipse Manufacturing. Reinhold has made it clear that I will not be\nCEO if they are successful. I can assure you that our shareholders will be better off in the\nlong term if I'm in charge.” Caper then shows Telline his projections for a new plan designed\nto boost both sales and operating margins.“I know that your firm is the trustee for our firm's\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). I hope that the trustee will vote in the best interest of\nour shareholders—and that would be a vote against the takeover offer.”After looking through\nCaper's business plans, Telline says, “This plan looks good. I will recommend that the trustee\nvote against the offer.”Caper responds, “I remember my friend Karen Leighton telling me that\nthe Leighton Family's Trust is managed by your firm. Perhaps the trustee could vote those\nshares against the acquisition as well. Karen Leighton is a close friend. I am sure that she\nwould agree.”Telline responds, “The Family Trust is no longer managed by Aiklin.” He adds,\n“I understand that the Trust is very conservatively managed. I doubt it that it would have\nholdings in Ellipse Manufacturing.” Telline does not mention that although the Family Trust\nhas changed investment managers, Karen Leighton remains an important client at Aiklin with\nsignificant personal holdings in Ellipse.After lunch, Telline meets with Sydney Brown, CFA,\ntrustee of the Ellipse ESOP. He shows her Caper's plan for improvements. “I think the plan is\na good one and Caper is one of the firm's most profitable accounts. We don't want to lose\nhim.” Brown agrees to analyze the plan. After thoroughly analyzing both the plan and the\ntakeover offer, Brown concludes that the takeover offer is best for the shareholders in the\nESOP and votes the plan's shares in favor of the takeover offer.A few months later the\nacquisition of Ellipse by Reinhold Partners is completed. Caper again meets Telline for lunch.\n“I received a generous severance package and I'm counting on you to manage my money well for\nme. While we are on the subject, I would like to be more aggressive with my portfolio. With my\nseverance package, I can take additional risk.” Telline and Caper discuss his current\nfinancial situation, risk tolerance, and financial objectives throughout lunch. Telline agrees\nto adjust Caper's investment policy statement (IPS) to reflect his greater appetite for risk\nand his increased wealth.Back at the office, Telline realizes that with the severance package,\nCaper is now his wealthiest client. He also realizes that Caper's increased appetite for risk\ngives him a risk profile similar to that of another client. He pulls a copy of the other\nclient's investment policy statement (IPS) and reviews it quickly before realizing that the two\nclients have very different tax situations. Telline quickly revises Caper's IPS to reflect the\nchanges in his financial situation. He uses the other client's IPS as a reference when revising\nthe section relating to Caper's risk tolerance. He then files the revised IPS in Caper's\nfile.The following week, an Aiklin analyst issues a buy recommendation on a small technology\ncompany with a promising software product. Telline reads the report carefully and concludes it\nwould be suitable under Caper's new IPS. Telline places an order for 10,000 shares in Caper's\naccount and then calls Caper to discuss the stock in more detail. Telline does not purchase the\nstock for any other clients. Although the one client has the same risk profile as Caper, that\nclient does not have cash available in his account and Telline determines that selling existing\nholdings does not make sense.In a subsequent telephone conversation, Caper expresses his\nlingering anger over the takeover. “You didn't do enough to persuade Aiklin's clients to vote\nagainst the takeover. Maybe I should look for an investment manager who is more loyal.”\nTelline tries to calm Caper but is unsuccessful. In an attempt to change the topic of\nconversation, Telline states, “The firm was just notified of our allocation of a long-awaited\nIPO. Your account should receive a significant allocation. I would hate to see you lose out by\nmoving your account.” Caper seems mollified and concludes the phone call, “I look forward to\na long-term relationship with you and your firm.”Aiklin distributes a copy of its firm\npolicies regarding IPO allocations to all clients annually. According to the policy, Aiklin\nallocates IPO shares to each investment manager and each manager has responsibility for\nallocating shares to accounts for which the IPO is suitable. The statement also discloses that\nAiklin offers different levels of service for different fees.After carefully reviewing the\nproposed IPO and his client accounts, Telline determines that the IPO is suitable for 11\nclients including Caper. Because the deal is oversubscribed, he receives only half of the\nshares he expected. Telline directs 50% of his allocation to Caper's account and divides the\nremaining 50% between the other ten accounts, each with a value equal to half of Caper's\naccount.\n "

I am sure that she\nwould agree.”Telline responds, “The Family Trust is no longer managed by Aiklin.” He adds,\n“I understand that the Trust is very conservatively managed. I doubt it that it would have\nholdings in Ellipse Manufacturing.” Telline does not mention that although the Family Trust\nhas changed investment managers, Karen Leighton remains an important client at Aiklin with\nsignificant personal holdings in Ellipse.After lunch, Telline meets with Sydney Brown, CFA,\ntrustee of the Ellipse ESOP. He shows her Caper's plan for improvements. “I think the plan is\na good one and Caper is one of the firm's most profitable accounts. We don't want to lose\nhim.” Brown agrees to analyze the plan. After thoroughly analyzing both the plan and the\ntakeover offer, Brown concludes that the takeover offer is best for the shareholders in the\nESOP and votes the plan's shares in favor of the takeover offer.A few months later the\nacquisition of Ellipse by Reinhold Partners is completed. Caper again meets Telline for lunch.\n“I received a generous severance package and I'm counting on you to manage my money well for\nme. While we are on the subject, I would like to be more aggressive with my portfolio. With my\nseverance package, I can take additional risk.” Telline and Caper discuss his current\nfinancial situation, risk tolerance, and financial objectives throughout lunch. Telline agrees\nto adjust Caper's investment policy statement (IPS) to reflect his greater appetite for risk\nand his increased wealth.Back at the office, Telline realizes that with the severance package,\nCaper is now his wealthiest client. He also realizes that Caper's increased appetite for risk\ngives him a risk profile similar to that of another client. He pulls a copy of the other\nclient's investment policy statement (IPS) and reviews it quickly before realizing that the two\nclients have very different tax situations. Telline quickly revises Caper's IPS to reflect the\nchanges in his financial situation. He uses the other client's IPS as a reference when revising\nthe section relating to Caper's risk tolerance. He then files the revised IPS in Caper's\nfile.The following week, an Aiklin analyst issues a buy recommendation on a small technology\ncompany with a promising software product. Telline reads the report carefully and concludes it\nwould be suitable under Caper's new IPS. Telline places an order for 10,000 shares in Caper's\naccount and then calls Caper to discuss the stock in more detail. Telline does not purchase the\nstock for any other clients. Although the one client has the same risk profile as Caper, that\nclient does not have cash available in his account and Telline determines that selling existing\nholdings does not make sense.In a subsequent telephone conversation, Caper expresses his\nlingering anger over the takeover. “You didn't do enough to persuade Aiklin's clients to vote\nagainst the takeover. Maybe I should look for an investment manager who is more loyal.”\nTelline tries to calm Caper but is unsuccessful. In an attempt to change the topic of\nconversation, Telline states, “The firm was just notified of our allocation of a long-awaited\nIPO. Your account should receive a significant allocation. I would hate to see you lose out by\nmoving your account.” Caper seems mollified and concludes the phone call, “I look forward to\na long-term relationship with you and your firm.”Aiklin distributes a copy of its firm\npolicies regarding IPO allocations to all clients annually. According to the policy, Aiklin\nallocates IPO shares to each investment manager and each manager has responsibility for\nallocating shares to accounts for which the IPO is suitable. The statement also discloses that\nAiklin offers different levels of service for different fees.After carefully reviewing the\nproposed IPO and his client accounts, Telline determines that the IPO is suitable for 11\nclients including Caper. Because the deal is oversubscribed, he receives only half of the\nshares he expected. Telline directs 50% of his allocation to Caper's account and divides the\nremaining 50% between the other ten accounts, each with a value equal to half of Caper's\naccount.\n "

            "Adam Craw, CFA, is chief executive officer (CEO) of Crawfood, a European private equity\nfirm specializing in food retailers. The retail food industry has been consolidating during the\npast two years as private equity funds have closed numerous deals and taken many companies\nprivate.Crawfood recently hired Lillian Voser, a CFA Level II candidate, as a controller. On\nVoser's first day of work, the head of personnel informs her that by signing the employment\ncontract, Voser agrees to comply with the company's code of ethics and compliance manual. She\nhands Voser copies of the code and compliance manual without further comment. Voser spends the\nnext hour reading both documents. An excerpt from the compliance manual appears in Exhibit 1.\nWhen she enters her new office that afternoon, Voser finds a large gift basket sent by her\nsister. The card reads “Congratulations on your new position.” The basket is filled with\nexpensive high-quality food items from Greenhornfood—a local small, publicly-traded food\nretailer, which produces many delicatessen products under its own brand name.During the next\ntwo weeks, Voser meets with all of Crawfood's upper management, including the CEO. In his\noffice, Craw praises Voser's efforts to complete the CFA program. “The program is demanding,\nbut it is worthwhile.” Craw then explains his investment strategy for choosing Crawfood's\nacquisition targets.

She considers it the best food retailer in the vicinity and she\nfrequently purchases its products.The following week, the local newspaper features an article\nabout Greenhornfood and its young founders. The article describes the company's loyal and\ngrowing customer base as well as its poor quarterly financial results. Voser notes that the\nstock has steadily declined during the past twelve months. She concludes that the company has\nan inexperienced management team, but its popular product line and loyal customer base make the\ncompany a potential acquisition target. Voser calls her sister and recommends that she purchase\nGreenhornfood shares because “it would be an attractive acquisition for a larger company.”\nBased on Voser's recommendation, her sister buys €3,000 worth of shares.During the following\ntwo weeks the stock price of Greenhornfood continues to decline. Voser's sister is uncertain of\nwhat she should do with her position. She seeks Voser's advice. Voser recommends that her\nsister wait another few days before making her decision and promises to analyze the situation\nin the meantime.While walking by Craw's office the following day, Voser sees a document with\nGreenhornfood's distinctive logo and overhears the company's name through an open office door.\nThat evening, Voser tells her sister, “with the price decline, the stock is even more\nattractive.” She recommends that her sister increase her position. Based on her recommendation\nher sister buys an additional €3,000 worth of Greenhornfood shares.One month later, Crawfood\npublicly announces the acquisition of Greenhornfood Company at a 20% premium to the previous\nday's closing price. Following the announcement, Voser's sister boasts about Voser's excellent\nrecommendation and timing to her broker.Regulatory authorities initiate an investigation into\nsuspicious trading in Greenhornfood shares and options preceding the formal announcement of the\nacquisition.

            "Adam Craw, CFA, is chief executive officer (CEO) of Crawfood, a European private equity\nfirm specializing in food retailers. The retail food industry has been consolidating during the\npast two years as private equity funds have closed numerous deals and taken many companies\nprivate.Crawfood recently hired Lillian Voser, a CFA Level II candidate, as a controller. On\nVoser's first day of work, the head of personnel informs her that by signing the employment\ncontract, Voser agrees to comply with the company's code of ethics and compliance manual. She\nhands Voser copies of the code and compliance manual without further comment. Voser spends the\nnext hour reading both documents. An excerpt from the compliance manual appears in Exhibit 1.\nWhen she enters her new office that afternoon, Voser finds a large gift basket sent by her\nsister. The card reads “Congratulations on your new position.” The basket is filled with\nexpensive high-quality food items from Greenhornfood—a local small, publicly-traded food\nretailer, which produces many delicatessen products under its own brand name.During the next\ntwo weeks, Voser meets with all of Crawfood's upper management, including the CEO. In his\noffice, Craw praises Voser's efforts to complete the CFA program. “The program is demanding,\nbut it is worthwhile.” Craw then explains his investment strategy for choosing Crawfood's\nacquisition targets. He points to a large map on the wall with multi-colored pins marking\nCrawfood's previous takeovers. The map shows acquisitions in all the major cities of Germany\nwith one exception—the home of Crawfood headquarters. Craw remarks, “We are currently in\ntalks for another purchase. Confidentiality prohibits me from discussing it any further, but\nyou will hear more about it soon.”Introduced to Greenhornfood by her sister, Voser quickly\nbecomes a loyal customer. She considers it the best food retailer in the vicinity and she\nfrequently purchases its products.The following week, the local newspaper features an article\nabout Greenhornfood and its young founders. The article describes the company's loyal and\ngrowing customer base as well as its poor quarterly financial results. Voser notes that the\nstock has steadily declined during the past twelve months. She concludes that the company has\nan inexperienced management team, but its popular product line and loyal customer base make the\ncompany a potential acquisition target. Voser calls her sister and recommends that she purchase\nGreenhornfood shares because “it would be an attractive acquisition for a larger company.”\nBased on Voser's recommendation, her sister buys €3,000 worth of shares.During the following\ntwo weeks the stock price of Greenhornfood continues to decline. Voser's sister is uncertain of\nwhat she should do with her position. She seeks Voser's advice. Voser recommends that her\nsister wait another few days before making her decision and promises to analyze the situation\nin the meantime.While walking by Craw's office the following day, Voser sees a document with\nGreenhornfood's distinctive logo and overhears the company's name through an open office door.\nThat evening, Voser tells her sister, “with the price decline, the stock is even more\nattractive.” She recommends that her sister increase her position. Based on her recommendation\nher sister buys an additional €3,000 worth of Greenhornfood shares.One month later, Crawfood\npublicly announces the acquisition of Greenhornfood Company at a 20% premium to the previous\nday's closing price. Following the announcement, Voser's sister boasts about Voser's excellent\nrecommendation and timing to her broker.Regulatory authorities initiate an investigation into\nsuspicious trading in Greenhornfood shares and options preceding the formal announcement of the\nacquisition. Craw receives a letter from regulatory authorities stating that he is the subject\nof a formal investigation into his professional conduct surrounding the acquisition. He learns\nfrom the compliance officer that Voser is also under investigation. The compliance officer\nprovides no details and out of respect for Voser's privacy, Craw makes no inquiries.The\nsituation remains unchanged and the matter is still pending with regulatory authorities several\nmonths later when Craw receives his annual Professional Conduct Statement (PCS) from CFA\nInstitute. He reviews the text asking “In the last two years, have you been . . . the subject\nof…any investigation…in which your professional conduct, in either a direct or supervisory\ncapacity, was at issue?”\n "
