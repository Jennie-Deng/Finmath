It follows that the subordinated debt can be modeled bya long call\noption with strike price = F and a short call with strike price = F+ U (not U). Statement c is\ncorrect. During financial distress, the equity valueis relatively small, and the subordinated\ndebt claim behaves more like equityas it is closer to receiving “residual” cash flows.\nSimilarly, when the firmvalue is relatively high, the subordinated debt claim behaves more like\ntraditionaldebt.",

The reference notional per\nindividual reference credit name is X/10. The default correlations between the individual\ncredit names are all equal to one. The single-name CDS spread for each individual name is 100\nbp, for a term of Y years. The assumed recovery rate on default for all individual reference\ncredits is zero in all cases.

The other answer\nchoices all describe formsof credit support that will support at least Tranches X and A, if not\nall 3tranches. By having Tranche Z be subordinate to Tranche X, Tranche X hasadditional\nsupport. Also, loans of $125 million are used to back asset-backedsecurities worth ($50 + $35 +\n$35) = $120 million, which means the issue, isover-collateralized.
