        "question_text": "Your colleague Peter is building a model that will estimate the sensitivity of your firm's bond portfolio to interest rate changes. He is evaluating six different models. Each of his candidate models shocks the rate, but each assumes a different interest rate factor as the model's core assumption. These are the six candidate interest rate factors: \nI Yield to maturity; aka, yield \nII 2-, 5-, 10-, and 30-year spot (aka, zero) rates \nIII 2-, 5-, 10-, and 30-year par yields \nIV Six month forward rates across the entire 30-year curve \nV Level and slope \nVI The continuously compounded, instantaneous rate, r(t). Which of the six are usable (i.e., viable) interest rate factors?",

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "It is easy to forget that duration and DV01 are typically yield-based duration and yield-based DV01; i.e., they express price change as a function of yield change. Yield is a popular and common interest rate factor because it is a one-factor formulation of interest rates: the entire term structure is summarized in a single yield. But more sophisticated models are multi-factor. They characterize the term structure, and consequently the interest rate risk factors, in plural terms. In this way, we can refer to the spot rate/forward rate/par yield at 2-, 5-, 10-, or 30-years, for example. Finally, per (VI.) the continuously compounded, instantaneous rate, r(t) is an important interest rate factor.",
