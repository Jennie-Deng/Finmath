To qualify for the income tax exemption, REITs\nare legally obligated to pay out a high percentage of income to their shareholders, and this\ntypically results in relatively high income for investors. Lastly, public REITs are generally\nliquid as they are traded in stock exchanges.",

McNeil's primary responsibility is\nrisk management. Katrina Falk, a recently hired junior analyst at Farmhouse, works for McNeil\nin managing the risk of the firm's commodity price exposures. Farmhouse's risk management\npolicy requires the use of futures to protect revenue from price volatility, regardless of\nforecasts of future prices, and prohibits risk managers from taking speculative\npositions.McNeil meets with Falk to discuss recent developments in two of Farmhouse's commodity\nmarkets, grains and livestock. McNeil asks Falk about key characteristics of the two markets\nthat affect revenues and costs. Falk tells McNeil the following:Statement 1 The life cycle for\nlivestock depends on the product and varies widely by product.Statement 2 Grains have uniform,\nwell-defined seasons and growth cycles specific to geographic regions.A material portion of\nFarmhouse's revenue comes from livestock exports, and a major input cost is the cost of grains\nimported from outside the United States. Falk and McNeil next discuss three conclusions that\nFalk reached in an analysis of the grains and livestock markets:Conclusion 1 Assuming demand\nfor grains remains constant, extreme heat in the regions from which we import our grains will\nresult in a benefit to us in the form of lower grain prices.Conclusion 2 New tariffs on cattle\nintroduced in our primary export markets will likely result in higher prices for our livestock\nproducts in our local market.Conclusion 3 Major improvements in freezing technology allowing\nfor longer storage will let us better manage the volatility in the prices of our livestock\nproducts.McNeil asks Falk to gather spot and futures price data on live cattle, wheat, and\nsoybeans, which are presented in Exhibit 1. Additionally, she observes that (1) the convenience\nyield of soybeans exceeds the costs of its direct storage and (2) commod-ity producers as a\ngroup are less interested in hedging in the forward market than commodity consumers are.\nA key input cost for Farmhouse in producing ethanol is natural gas. McNeil uses positions in\nnatural gas (NG) futures contracts to manage the risk of natural gas price volatility. Three\nmonths ago, she entered into a long position in natural gas futures at a futures price of $2.93\nper million British thermal units (MMBtu).

If consumers are more interested in hedging than\nproducers are, the futures price will exceed the spot price.In contrast, the insurance theory\npredicts that the futures price has to be lower than the current spot price as a form of\npayment or remuneration to the speculator who takes on the price risk and provides price\ninsurance to the commodity seller. Similarly, the theory of storage also predicts that when a\ncommodity's convenience yield is greater than its direct storage costs, the futures price will\nbe lower than the spot price.",

They review Brent crude oil futures data, which are presented\nin Exhibit 1.\nYamata presents his research related to the energy sector, which has the following\nconclusions:■ Consumers have been more concerned about prices than producers have.■ Energy is\nconsumed on a real-time basis and requires minimal storage.After concluding the discussion of\nthe energy sector, Nabli reviews the performance of NWC's long position in lean hog futures\ncontracts. Nabli notes that the portfolio earned a –12% price return on the lean hog futures\nposition last year and a –24% roll return after the contracts were rolled forward. The\nposition was held with collateral equal to 100% of the position at a risk-free rate of 1.2% per\nyear.Yamata asks Nabli to clarify how the state of the futures market affects roll returns.\nNabli responds as follows:Statement 4 Roll returns are generally negative when a futures market\nis in contango.Statement 5 Roll returns are generally positive when a futures market is in\nbackwardation.As part of their expansion into new markets, NWC is considering changing its\nbenchmark index. Nabli investigates two indexes as a possible replacement. These indexes both\nuse similar weighting and rebalancing schemes. Index A includes con-tracts of commodities\ntypically in contango, whereas Index B includes contracts of commodities typically in\nbackwardation. Nabli asks Yamata how the two indexes perform relative to each other in a market\nthat is trending upward.Because of a substantial decline in drilling activity in the North Sea,\nNabli believes the price of Brent crude oil will increase more than that of heavy crude oil.\nThe actual price volatility of Brent crude oil has been lower than its expected volatility, and\nNabli expects this trend to continue. Nabli also expects the level of the ICE Brent Index to\nincrease from its current level. Nabli and Yamata discuss how to use swaps to take advantage of\nNabli's expectations. The possible positions are (1) a basis swap long on Brent crude oil and\nshort on heavy crude oil, (2) a long volatility swap on Brent crude oil, and (3) a short\nposition in an excess return swap that is based on a fixed level (i.e., the current level) of\nthe ICE Brent Index.\n "

Tseng and Collin meet to\ndiscuss existing and potential investments.Tseng starts the meeting with a discussion of LBO\nfirms and VC firms. Collin tells Tseng,LBO firms tend to invest in companies with predicable\ncash flows and experienced management teams, whereas VC firms tend to invest in companies with\nhigh EBITDA or EBIT growth and where an exit is fairly predictable.Tseng and Collin next\nanalyze a potential investment in the leveraged buyout of Stoneham Industries. Specifically,\nthey assess the expected gain if they elect to purchase all the preference shares and 90% of\nthe common equity in the LBO. Details of the LBO include the following:●The buyout requires an\ninitial investment of $10 million.●Financing for the deal includes $6 million in debt, $3.6\nmillion in preference shares that promise a 15% annual return paid at exit, and $0.4 million in\ncommon equity.The expected exit value in six years is $15 million, with an estimated reduction\nin debt of $2.8 million over the six years prior to exit.Tseng and Collin next discuss JRR's\ninvestment in Venture Holdings, a private equity fund. Selected details on the Venture Holdings\nfund include the following:●Total committed capital is $115 million.●The distribution\nwaterfall follows the deal-by-deal method, and carried interest is 20%.●On its first exit\nevent a few years ago, the fund generated a $10 million profit.●At the end of the most recent\nyear, cumulative paid-in capital was $98 million, cumulative distributions paid out to LPs were\n$28 million, and the year-end NAV, before and after distributions, was $170.52 million and\n$131.42 million, respectively.●Tseng and Collin estimate that the fund's NAV before\ndistributions will be $242.32 million at the end of next year.Finally, Tseng and Collin\nevaluate two venture capital funds for potential investment: the Squire Fund and the Treble\nFund. Both funds are in Year 7 of an estimated 10-year term. Selected data for the two funds\nare presented in Exhibit 1.\nAfter reviewing the performance data in Exhibit 1, Collin draws the following\nconclusions:Conclusion 1 The unrealized return on investment for the Squire Fund is greater\nthan the unrealized return on investment for the Treble Fund.Conclusion 2 The TVPI for the\nTreble Fund is higher than the TVPI for the Squire Fund because the Treble Fund has a higher\ngross IRR.\n "

Various contractual clauses are\ninserted in the compensation contracts of the management team in order to reward or punish\nmanagers who meet or do not meet agreed-upon target objectives.\nOne concern Chau highlights is the illiquidity of private equity investments over time. Some\nfunds are returned to investors, however, over the life of the fund because a number of\ninvestment opportunities are exited early. Provisions in a fund’s prospectus describe the\ndistribution of returns to investors, some of which favor the limited partners. One such\nprovision is the distribution waterfall mechanism that provides distributions to limited\npartners (LPs) before the general partner (GP) receives the carried interest. This distribution\nmechanism is called the total return waterfall.\nChau prepares the following data to illustrate the distribution waterfall mechanism and the\nfunds provided to limited partners when a private equity fund with a zero hurdle rate exits\nfrom its first three projects during a three-year period.\nChau cautions that investors must understand the terminology used to describe the performance\nof private equity funds. Interpretation of performance numbers should be made with the\nawareness that much of the fund assets are illiquid during a substantial part of the fund’s\nlife. She provides the latest data in Exhibit 2 for the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Funds,\ndiversified high-technology venture capital funds formed five years ago, each with five years\nremaining to termination.\nChau studies the data and comments, Of the three funds, the Alpha Fund has the best chance to\noutperform over the remaining life. First, it’s because the management has earned such a\nrelatively high residual value on capital and will be able to earn a high return on the\nremaining funds called down. At termination, the RVPI will be double the 0.65 value when the\nrest of the funds are called down. Second, its cash-on-cash return as measured by DPI is\nalready as high as that of the Beta Fund. The PIC (or paid-in capital) ratio indicates the\nproportion of capital already called by the GP. The PIC of Alpha is relatively low relative to\nBeta and Gamma.\nHermansky notes that a private equity fund’s ability to properly plan and execute its exit\nfrom an investment is vital for the fund’s success. Venture funds, such as Alpha, Beta, and\nGamma, take special care to plan their exits.\nBrady then asks the analysts what procedures private equity firms would use to value\ninvestments in their portfolios as well as investments that are added later. She is concerned\nabout buying into a fund with existing assets that do not have public market prices that can be\nused to ascertain value. In such cases, she worries, what if a GP overvalues the assets and new\ninvestors in the fund pay more for the fund assets than they are worth?\nHermansky makes three statements regarding the valuation methods used in private equity\ntransactions during the early stages of selling a fund to investors.\nStatement 1: For venture capital investment in the early stages of analysis, emphasis is placed\non the discounted cash flow approach to valuation.\nStatement 2: For buyout investments, income-based approaches are used frequently as a primary\nmethod of valuation.\nStatement 3: If a comparable group of companies exist, multiples of revenues or earnings are\nused frequently to derive a value for venture capital investments.\n "
