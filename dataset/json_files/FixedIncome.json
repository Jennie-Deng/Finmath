The put option embedded in the CE bond is not in the money; the bond is currently\npriced 2.1% above par value. Thus, at the current price, the putable CE bond is more likely to\nbehave like the option-free BI bond.

            "John Smith, a fixed-income portfolio manager at a €10 billion sovereign wealth fund\n(the Fund), meets with Sofia Chan, a derivatives strategist with Shire Gate Securities (SGS),\nto discuss investment opportunities for the Fund. Chan notes that SGS adheres to ISDA\n(International Swaps and Derivatives Association) protocols for credit default swap (CDS)\ntransactions and that any contract must conform to ISDA specifications. Before the Fund can\nengage in trading CDS products with SGS, the Fund must satisfy compliance requirements.\nSmith explains to Chan that fixed-income derivatives strategies are being contemplated for both\nhedging and trading purposes. Given the size and diversified nature of the Fund, Smith asks\nChan to recommend a type of CDS that would allow the Fund to simultaneously fully hedge\nmultiple fixed-income exposures.\nSmith and Chan discuss opportunities to add trading profits to the Fund. Smith asks Chan to\ndetermine the probability of default associated with a five-year investment-grade bond issued\nby Orion Industrial. Selected data on the Orion Industrial bond are presented in Exhibit 1.\nChan explains that a single-name CDS can also be used to add profit to the Fund over time. Chan\ndescribes a hypothetical trade in which the Fund sells ￡6 million of five-year CDS protection\non Orion, where the CDS contract has a duration of 3.9 years. Chan assumes that the Fund closes\nthe position six months later, after Orion’s credit spread narrowed from 150 bps to 100 bps.\nChan discusses the mechanics of a long/short trade. In order to structure a number of potential\ntrades, Chan and Smith exchange their respective views on individual companies and global\neconomies. Chan and Smith agree on the following outlooks.\nOutlook 1: The European economy will weaken.\nOutlook 2: The US economy will strengthen relative to that of Canada.\nOutlook 3: The credit quality of electric car manufacturers will improve relative to that of\ntraditional car manufacturers.\nChan believes US macroeconomic data are improving and that the general economy will strengthen\nin the short term. Chan suggests that a curve trade could be used by the Fund to capitalize on\nher short-term view of a steepening of the US credit curve.\nAnother short-term trading opportunity that Smith and Chan discuss involves the merger and\nacquisition market. SGS believes that Delta Corporation may make an unsolicited bid at a\npremium to the market price for all of the publicly traded shares of Zega, Inc. Zega’s market\ncapitalization and capital structure are comparable to Delta’s; both firms are highly levered.\nIt is anticipated that Delta will issue new equity along with 5- and 10-year senior unsecured\ndebt to fund the acquisition, which will significantly increase its debt ratio.\n "

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The shares of Zega can be sold at a higher price as a result of the unsolicited bid\nin the market. If Delta Corporation issues significantly more debt, there is a higher\nprobability that it may default. If the Fund sells protection on Delta now, the trade will\nrealize a profit as credit spreads widen. An equity-versus-credit trade would be to go long\n(buy) the Zega shares and buy protection on Delta.",

        "explanation": "Effective duration indicates the sensitivity of a bond's price to a 100 bps\nparallel shift of the benchmark yield curve assuming no change in the bond's credit spread. The\neffective duration of an option-free bond such as Bond #3 changes very little in response to\ninterest rate movements. As interest rates rise, a call option moves out of the money, which\nincreases the value of the callable bond and lengthens its effective duration. In contrast, as\ninterest rates rise, a put option moves into the money, which limits the price depreciation of\nthe putable bond and shortens its effective duration. Thus, the bond whose effective duration\nwill lengthen if interest rates rise is the callable bond, i.e., Bond #4.",

        "explanation": "The risk-return characteristics of a convertible bond depend on the market price of\nthe issuer's common stock (underlying share price) relative to the bond's conversion price.\nWhen the underlying share price is well below the conversion price, the convertible bond\nexhibits mostly bond risk-return characteristics. In this case, the price of the convertible\nbond is mainly affected by interest rate movements and the issuer's credit spreads. In\ncontrast, when the underlying share price is above the conversion price, the convertible bond\nexhibits mostly stock risk-return characteristics. In this case, the price of the convertible\nbond is mainly affected by the issuer's common stock price movements. The underlying share\nprice ($30) is lower than the conversion price of Bond #9 ($50).

        "explanation": "The first step in the solution is to find the correct spot rate (zero-coupon rates)\nfor each year’s cash flow. The benchmark bonds in Exhibit 2 are conveniently priced at par so\nthe yields to maturity and the coupon rates on the bonds are the same. Because the one-year\nissue has only one cash flow remaining, the YTM equals the spot rate of 3% (or z<sub>1</sub> =\n3%). The spot rates for Year 2 (z<sub>2</sub>) and Year 3 (z<sub>3</sub>) are calculated as\nfollows:The correct arbitrage-free price for the Hutto-Barkley Inc. bond\nis:P<sub>0</sub>=3/(1.0300)＋3/(1.0402)2＋103/(1.0507)3=94.4828Therefore, the bond is mispriced\nby 94.4828 – 94.9984 = –0.5156 per 100 of par value.A is incorrect because the correct spot\nrates are not calculated and instead the Hutto-Barkley Inc. bond is discounted using the\nrespective YTM for each maturity. Therefore, this leads to an incorrect mispricing of 94.6616\n– 94.9984 = –0.3368 per 100 of par value.B is incorrect because the spot rates are derived\nusing the coupon rate for Year 3 (maturity) instead of using each year’s respective coupon\nrate to employ the bootstrap methodology. This leads to an incorrect mispricing of 94.5302 –\n94.9984 = –0.4682 per 100 of par value.",
