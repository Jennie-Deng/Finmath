            "Sanober Hirji is a junior analyst with Northco Securities, which is based in Canada.\nThe institutional clients of Northco are active investors in Canadian coupon-bearing government\nbonds. Client portfolios are benchmarked to a Canadian government bond index, which is a\ndiverse maturity index portfolio. After reviewing the portfolio of a French institutional\nclient, Hirji evaluates yield curve strategies for Canadian government bond portfolios under\nvarious interest rate scenarios. Hirji’s supervisor, éliane Prégent, forecasts that Canadian\nlong-term rates will rise and short-term rates will fall over the next 12 months.In contrast,\nNorthco’s chief economist forecasts that Canadian interest rates will increase or decrease by\n100 basis points over the next 12 months. Based on the chief economist’s forecast, Hirji\nsuggests increasing the convexity of the French institutional client’s portfolio by selling\n10-year bonds and investing the proceeds in a duration-matched barbell position of Canadian\ngovernment 3-year and long-term bonds. She notes that the duration of the 10-year bonds, along\nwith the durations of the other portfolio bonds, aligns the portfolio’s effective duration\nwith that of the benchmark. Selected data on Canadian government bonds are presented in Exhibit\n1.\n(* There is no single convention for how convexity numbers are presented; for example,\nBloomberg has historically followed a convention of dividing the “raw” convexity number by\n100 (as presented here). However, it is important to use the raw convexity number when\nestimating returns.)Hirji then considers a strategy to sell some long-term bonds from the\nFrench institutional client’s portfolio and purchase short maturity at-the-money options on\nlong-term bond futures. The portfolio’s duration would remain unchanged. Prégent asks:“How\nwould portfolio performance be affected by this strategy if the yield curve were to remain\nstable?”Hirji also proposes the following duration-neutral trades for the French institutional\nclient:\nLong/short trade on 1-year and 3-year Canadian government bonds\nShort/long trade on 10-year and long-term Canadian government bonds\nSix months later, Hirji reviews Canadian government bonds for a Malaysian institutional client.\nPrégent and Hirji expect changes in the curvature of the yield curve but are not sure whether\ncurvature will increase or decrease. Hirji first analyzes positions that would profit from an\nincrease in the curvature of the yield curve. The positions must be duration neutral, and the\nmaximum position that the Malaysian client can take in long-term bonds is C$150 million. Hirji\nnotes that interest rates have increased by 100 basis points over the past six months. Selected\ndata for on-the-run Canadian government bonds are shown in Exhibit 2.\nHirji then considers the scenario where the yield curve will lose curvature for the Malaysian\ninstitutional client. She notes that a 7-year Canadian government bond is also available in the\nmarket. Hirji proposes a duration-neutral portfolio comprised of 47% in 5-year bonds and 53% in\n7-year bonds.Finally, Hirji uses the components of expected returns to compare the performance\nof a bullet portfolio and a barbell portfolio for a British institutional client.\nCharacteristics of these portfolios are shown in Exhibit 3.\n \n "

            "Sanober Hirji is a junior analyst with Northco Securities, which is based in Canada.\nThe institutional clients of Northco are active investors in Canadian coupon-bearing government\nbonds. Client portfolios are benchmarked to a Canadian government bond index, which is a\ndiverse maturity index portfolio. After reviewing the portfolio of a French institutional\nclient, Hirji evaluates yield curve strategies for Canadian government bond portfolios under\nvarious interest rate scenarios. Hirji’s supervisor, éliane Prégent, forecasts that Canadian\nlong-term rates will rise and short-term rates will fall over the next 12 months.In contrast,\nNorthco’s chief economist forecasts that Canadian interest rates will increase or decrease by\n100 basis points over the next 12 months. Based on the chief economist’s forecast, Hirji\nsuggests increasing the convexity of the French institutional client’s portfolio by selling\n10-year bonds and investing the proceeds in a duration-matched barbell position of Canadian\ngovernment 3-year and long-term bonds. She notes that the duration of the 10-year bonds, along\nwith the durations of the other portfolio bonds, aligns the portfolio’s effective duration\nwith that of the benchmark.

            "Sanober Hirji is a junior analyst with Northco Securities, which is based in Canada.\nThe institutional clients of Northco are active investors in Canadian coupon-bearing government\nbonds. Client portfolios are benchmarked to a Canadian government bond index, which is a\ndiverse maturity index portfolio. After reviewing the portfolio of a French institutional\nclient, Hirji evaluates yield curve strategies for Canadian government bond portfolios under\nvarious interest rate scenarios. Hirji’s supervisor, éliane Prégent, forecasts that Canadian\nlong-term rates will rise and short-term rates will fall over the next 12 months.In contrast,\nNorthco’s chief economist forecasts that Canadian interest rates will increase or decrease by\n100 basis points over the next 12 months. Based on the chief economist’s forecast, Hirji\nsuggests increasing the convexity of the French institutional client’s portfolio by selling\n10-year bonds and investing the proceeds in a duration-matched barbell position of Canadian\ngovernment 3-year and long-term bonds. She notes that the duration of the 10-year bonds, along\nwith the durations of the other portfolio bonds, aligns the portfolio’s effective duration\nwith that of the benchmark. Selected data on Canadian government bonds are presented in Exhibit\n1.\n(* There is no single convention for how convexity numbers are presented; for example,\nBloomberg has historically followed a convention of dividing the “raw” convexity number by\n100 (as presented here). However, it is important to use the raw convexity number when\nestimating returns.)Hirji then considers a strategy to sell some long-term bonds from the\nFrench institutional client’s portfolio and purchase short maturity at-the-money options on\nlong-term bond futures. The portfolio’s duration would remain unchanged. Prégent asks:“How\nwould portfolio performance be affected by this strategy if the yield curve were to remain\nstable?”Hirji also proposes the following duration-neutral trades for the French institutional\nclient:\nLong/short trade on 1-year and 3-year Canadian government bonds\nShort/long trade on 10-year and long-term Canadian government bonds\nSix months later, Hirji reviews Canadian government bonds for a Malaysian institutional client.\nPrégent and Hirji expect changes in the curvature of the yield curve but are not sure whether\ncurvature will increase or decrease. Hirji first analyzes positions that would profit from an\nincrease in the curvature of the yield curve. The positions must be duration neutral, and the\nmaximum position that the Malaysian client can take in long-term bonds is C$150 million. Hirji\nnotes that interest rates have increased by 100 basis points over the past six months. Selected\ndata for on-the-run Canadian government bonds are shown in Exhibit 2.\nHirji then considers the scenario where the yield curve will lose curvature for the Malaysian\ninstitutional client. She notes that a 7-year Canadian government bond is also available in the\nmarket. Hirji proposes a duration-neutral portfolio comprised of 47% in 5-year bonds and 53% in\n7-year bonds.Finally, Hirji uses the components of expected returns to compare the performance\nof a bullet portfolio and a barbell portfolio for a British institutional client.\nCharacteristics of these portfolios are shown in Exhibit 3.\n \n "

            "Celia Deveraux is chief investment officer for the Topanga Investors Fund, which\ninvests in equities and fixed income. The clients in the fund are all taxable investors. The\nfixed-income allocation includes a domestic (US) bond portfolio and an externally managed\nglobal bond portfolio.The domestic bond portfolio has a total return mandate, which specifies a\nlong-term return objective of 25 basis points (bps) over the benchmark index. Relative to the\nbenchmark, small deviations in sector weightings are permitted, such risk factors as duration\nmust closely match, and tracking error is expected to be less than 50 bps per year.The\nobjectives for the domestic bond portfolio include the ability to fund future liabilities,\nprotect interest income from short-term inflation, and minimize the correlation with the\nfund’s equity portfolio. The correlation between the fund’s domestic bond portfolio and\nequity portfolio is currently 0.14. Deveraux plans to reduce the fund’s equity allocation and\nincrease the allocation to the domestic bond portfolio. She reviews two possible investment\nstrategies.Strategy 1 Purchase AAA rated fixed-coupon corporate bonds with a modified duration\nof two years and a correlation coefficient with the equity portfolio of –0.15.Strategy\n2 Purchase US government agency floating-coupon bonds with a modified duration of one month\nand a correlation coefficient with the equity portfolio of –0.10Deveraux realizes that the\nfund’s return may decrease if the equity allocation of the fund is reduced. Deveraux decides\nto liquidate $20 million of US Treasuries that are currently owned and to invest the proceeds\nin the US corporate bond sector. To fulfill this strategy, Deveraux asks Dan Foster, a newly\nhired analyst for the fund, to recommend Treasuries to sell and corporate bonds to\npurchase.Foster recommends Treasuries from the existing portfolio that he believes are\novervalued and will generate capital gains. Deveraux asks Foster why he chose only overvalued\nbonds with capital gains and did not include any bonds with capital losses. Foster responds\nwith two statements.Statement 1 Taxable investors should prioritize selling overvalued bonds\nand always sell them before selling bonds that are viewed as fairly valued or\nundervalued.Statement 2 Taxable investors should never intentionally realize capital\nlosses.Regarding the purchase of corporate bonds, Foster collects relevant data, which are\npresented in Exhibit 1\nDeveraux and Foster review the total expected 12-month return (assuming no reinvestment income)\nfor the global bond portfolio. Selected financial data are presented in Exhibit 2.\nDeveraux contemplates adding a new manager to the global bond portfolio. She reviews three\nproposals and determines that each manager uses the same index as its benchmark but pursues a\ndifferent total return approach, as presented in Exhibit 3.\n \n "

Riding\nthe yield curve is a strategy based on the premise that, as a bond ages, it will decline in\nyield if the yield curve is upward sloping. This is known as “roll down”; that is, the bond\nrolls down the (static) curve. Riding the yield curve differs from buy and hold in that the\nmanager is expecting to add to returns by selling the security at a lower yield at the horizon.\nThis strategy may be particularly effective if the portfolio manager targets portions of the\nyield curve that are relatively steep and where price appreciation resulting from the\nbond’ration to maturity can be significant.

McLaughlin suggests that Donaldson consider a butterfly\ntrade or a condor trade using some combination of 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year\nbonds.Donaldson suggests they also consider altering the portfolio’s convexity to enhance\nexpected return given McLaughlin’s interest rate expectations. Donaldson tells McLaughlin the\nfollowing.\nStatement 1 Portfolios with larger convexities often have higher yields.\nStatement 2 If yields rise, a portfolio of a given duration with higher convexity will\nexperience less of a price decrease than a similar-duration, lower-convexity portfolio.\n "

The two-year yield is expected to slightly increase by 0.04%, resulting in\nminimal price impact given the relatively low duration of two-year bonds. Similarly, the 30-\nyear yield is expected to remain constant, resulting in minimal price impact as well. The 10-\nyear yield ( 0.50%) is expected to increase by more than the 5-year yield ( 0.40%), and with\nits higher effective duration, the 10-year would be appropriate for the short bullet part of\nthe butterfly trade.",
