The\nvalue of the replicating portfolio is nSS + nBB = -0.3783(57.03) + 0.4404(54.97) = $2.6343 (the\nvalue of the put option with slight rounding error).

For the example in this case, the value of the call option is 3.714. If the option is overpriced at, say, 4.50, you short the option and have a cash flow at Time 0 of +4.50. You buy the replicating portfolio of 0.60 shares at 50 per share (giving you a cash flow of -30) and borrow $(1/1.05) \\times [(0.60 \\times 46) - 0] = (1/1.05) \\times 27.6 = 26.287$.

It is a\nnon-dividend-paying stock, and the inputs are as follows.● The current stock price is 50, and\nthe call option exercise price is 50.● In one period, the stock price will either rise to 56\nor decline to 46.● The risk-free rate of return is 5% per period.Based on the model, Rocha\nasks Sousa to estimate the hedge ratio, the risk-neutral probability of an up move, and the\nprice of the call option. In the illustration, Sousa is also asked to describe related\narbitrage positions to use if the call option is overpriced relative to the model.Beta\nCompanyNext, Sousa uses the two-period binomial model to estimate the value of a European-\nstyle call option on Beta Company's common shares. The inputs are as follows.\n● The current stock price is 38, and the call option exercise price is 40.\n● The up factor (u) is 1.300, and the down factor (d) is 0.800.\n● The risk-free rate of return is 3% per period.\nSousa then analyzes a put option on the same stock. All of the inputs, including the exercise\nprice, are the same as for the call option. He estimates that the value of a European-style put\noption is 4.53. Exhibit 1 summarizes his analysis. Sousa next must determine whether an\nAmerican-style put option would have the same value.Exhibit 1. Two-period Binomial European-\nStyle Put Option on Beta Company\nSousa makes two statements with regard to the valuation of a European-style option under the\nexpectations approach.Statement 1: The calculation involves discounting at the risk-free\nrate.Statement 2: The calculation uses risk-neutral probabilities instead of true\nprobabilities.Rocha asks Sousa whether it is ever profitable to exercise American options prior\nto maturity. Sousa answers, “I can think of two possible cases. The first case is the early\nexercise of an American call option on a dividend-paying stock. The second case is the early\nexercise of an American put option.”\nInterest Rate OptionThe final option valuation task involves an interest rate option. Sousa\nmust value a two-year, European-style call option on a one-year spot rate. The notional value\nof the option is 1 million, and the exercise rate is 2.75%. The risk-neutral probability of an\nup move is 0.50. The current and expected one-year interest rates are shown in Exhibit 2, along\nwith the values of a one-year zero-coupon bond of 1 notional value for each interest\nrate.Exhibit 2.

At Time Step 1, for the up move, $p^{++}$ is 0.2517 and the put is out of the money and should not be exercised early (X < S, 40 < 49.4). However, at Time Step 1, $p^{+-}$ is 8.4350 and the put is in the money by 9.60 (X - S = 40 - 30.40). So, the put is exercised early, and the value of early exercise (9.60) replaces the value of not exercising early (8.4350) in the binomial tree.

            "Tim Doyle is a portfolio manager at BestFutures Group, a hedge fund that frequently\nenters into derivative contracts either to hedge the risk of investments it holds or to\nspeculate outside of those investments. Doyle works alongside Diane Kemper, a junior analyst at\nthe hedge fund. They meet to evaluate new investment ideas and to review several of the firm’s\nexisting investments.Carry Arbitrage ModelDoyle and Kemper discuss the carry arbitrage model\nand how they can take advantage of mispricing in bond markets. Specifically, they would like to\nexecute an arbitrage transaction on a Eurodollar futures contract in which the underlying\nEurodollar bond is expected to make an interest payment in two months. Doyle makes the\nfollowing statements:Statement 1: If the Eurodollar futures price is less than the price\nsuggested by the carry arbitrage model, the futures contract should be purchased.Statement 2:\nBased on the cost of carry model, the futures price would be higher if the underlying\nEurodollar bond’s upcoming interest payment was expected in five months instead of two.\nThree-Year Treasury Note Futures ContractKemper then presents two investment ideas to Doyle.\nKemper’s first investment idea is to purchase a three-year Treasury note futures contract. The\nunderlying 1.5%, semi-annual three-year Treasury note is quoted at a clean price of 101. It has\nbeen 60 days since the three-year Treasury note’s last coupon payment, and the next coupon\npayment is payable in 120 days. Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the full spot price of the\nunderlying three-year Treasury note.10-Year Treasury Note Futures ContractKemper’s second\ninvestment idea is to purchase a 10-year Treasury note futures contract. The underlying 2%,\nsemi-annual 10-year Treasury note has a dirty price of 104.17. It has been 30 days since the\n10-year Treasury note’s last coupon payment. The futures contract expires in 90 days. The\nquoted futures contract price is 129. The current annualized three-month risk-free rate is\n1.65%. The conversion factor is 0.7025. Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the equilibrium quoted\nfutures contract price based on the carry arbitrage model.\nJapanese Government BondsAfter discussing Kemper’s new investment ideas, Doyle and Kemper\nevaluate one of their existing forward contract positions. Three months ago, BestFutures took a\nlong position in eight 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) forward contracts, with each\ncontract having a contract notional value of 100 million yen. The contracts had a price of\nJPY153 (quoted as a percentage of par) when the contracts were purchased.Now, the contracts\nhave six months left to expiration and have a price of JPY155. The annualized six-month\ninterest rate is 0.12%. Doyle asks Kemper to value the JGB forward position.\nInterest Rate SwapsAdditionally, Doyle asks Kemper to price a one-year plain vanilla swap. The\nspot rates and days to maturity at each payment date are presented in Exhibit 1.\nFinally, Doyle and Kemper review one of BestFutures’s pay-fixed interest rate swap positions.\nTwo years ago, the firm entered into a JPY5 billion five-year interest rate swap, paying the\nfixed rate. The fixed rate when BestFutures entered into the swap two years ago was 0.10%. The\ncurrent term structure of interest rates for JPY cash flows, which are relevant to the interest\nrate swap position, is presented in Exhibit 2.\nDoyle asks Kemper to calculate the value of the pay-fixed interest rate swap.\n "

Unless the Eurodollar futures contract’s\nquoted price is equal to the no-arbitrage futures price, there is an arbitrage opportunity.\nMoreover, if the quoted futures price is less than the no-arbitrage futures price, then to take\nadvantage of the arbitrage opportunity, the Eurodollar futures contract should be purchased and\nthe underlying Eurodollar bond should be sold short. Doyle would then lend the short sale\nproceeds at the risk-free rate. The strategy that comprises those transactions is known as\nreverse carry arbitrage.\nDoyle’s second statement is also correct. Based on the cost of carry model, the futures price\nis calculated as the future value of the sum of the underlying plus the underlying carry costs\nminus the future value of any ownership benefits. If the Eurodollar bond’s interest payment\nwas expected in five months instead of two, the benefit of the cash flow would occur three\nmonths later, so the future value of the benefits term would be slightly lower. Therefore, the\nEurodollar futures contract price would be slightly higher if the Eurodollar bond’s interest\npayment was expected in five months instead of two months.\nA is incorrect because Doyle’s Statement 2 is correct (not incorrect). Based on the cost of\ncarry model, the futures price would be higher if the underlying Eurodollar bond’s interest\npayment took place in five months instead of two months.\nB is incorrect because Doyle’s Statement 1 is correct (not incorrect).

It has\nbeen 60 days since the three-year Treasury note’s last coupon payment, and the next coupon\npayment is payable in 120 days. Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the full spot price of the\nunderlying three-year Treasury note.10-Year Treasury Note Futures ContractKemper’s second\ninvestment idea is to purchase a 10-year Treasury note futures contract. The underlying 2%,\nsemi-annual 10-year Treasury note has a dirty price of 104.17. It has been 30 days since the\n10-year Treasury note’s last coupon payment. The futures contract expires in 90 days. The\nquoted futures contract price is 129. The current annualized three-month risk-free rate is\n1.65%. The conversion factor is 0.7025. Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the equilibrium quoted\nfutures contract price based on the carry arbitrage model.\nJapanese Government BondsAfter discussing Kemper’s new investment ideas, Doyle and Kemper\nevaluate one of their existing forward contract positions. Three months ago, BestFutures took a\nlong position in eight 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) forward contracts, with each\ncontract having a contract notional value of 100 million yen. The contracts had a price of\nJPY153 (quoted as a percentage of par) when the contracts were purchased.Now, the contracts\nhave six months left to expiration and have a price of JPY155. The annualized six-month\ninterest rate is 0.12%. Doyle asks Kemper to value the JGB forward position.\nInterest Rate SwapsAdditionally, Doyle asks Kemper to price a one-year plain vanilla swap. The\nspot rates and days to maturity at each payment date are presented in Exhibit 1.\nFinally, Doyle and Kemper review one of BestFutures’s pay-fixed interest rate swap positions.\nTwo years ago, the firm entered into a JPY5 billion five-year interest rate swap, paying the\nfixed rate. The fixed rate when BestFutures entered into the swap two years ago was 0.10%. The\ncurrent term structure of interest rates for JPY cash flows, which are relevant to the interest\nrate swap position, is presented in Exhibit 2.\nDoyle asks Kemper to calculate the value of the pay-fixed interest rate swap.\n "
