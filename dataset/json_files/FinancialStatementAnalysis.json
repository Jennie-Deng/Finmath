Dodd meets with Sonya Webster,\nthe firm's analyst responsible for the machinery industry, to discuss three established\ncompanies: BIG Industrial, Construction Supply, and Dynamic Production. Webster provides Dodd\nwith research notes for each company that reflect trends during the last three years:BIG\nIndustrial:Note 1Operating income has been much lower than operating cash flow (OCF).Note\n2Accounts payable has increased, while accounts receivable and inventory have substantially\ndecreased.Note 3Although OCF was positive, it was just sufficient to cover capital\nexpenditures, dividends, and debt repayments.Construction Supply:Note 4Operating margins have\nbeen relatively constant.Note 5The growth rate in revenue has exceeded the growth rate in\nreceivables.Note 6OCF was stable and positive, close to its reported net income, and just\nsufficient to cover capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments.Dynamic\nProduction:Note 7OCF has been more volatile than that of other industry participants.Note 8OCF\nhas fallen short of covering capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments.Dodd asks\nWebster about the use of quantitative tools to assess the likelihood of misreporting. Webster\ntells Dodd she uses the Beneish model, and she presents the estimated M-scores for each company\nin Exhibit 1.\nWebster tells Dodd that Dynamic Production was required to restate its 2016 financial\nstatements as a result of its attempt to inflate sales revenue. Customers of Dynamic Production\nwere encouraged to take excess product in 2016, and they were then allowed to return purchases\nin the subsequent period, without penalty.Webster's industry analysis leads her to believe that\ninnovations have caused some of the BIG Industrial's inventory to become obsolete. Webster\nexpresses concern to Dodd that although the notes to the financial statements for BIG\nIndustrial are informative about its inventory cost methods, its inventory is overstated.The\nBIG Industrial income statement reflects a profitable 49% unconsolidated equity investment.\nWebster calculates the return on sales of BIG Industrial based on the reported income\nstatement. Dodd notes that industry peers consolidate similar investments. Dodd asks Webster to\nuse a comparable method of calculating the return on sales for BIG Industrial.\n "

The inventory\ncost is determined using the FB/NVK exchange rate of 4.1779 on the purchase date of 1 June\n2016.FB27,000/FB4.1779/NVK = NVK6,462.58/tonThe cash outflow is the amount exchanged from the\nNorvoltian krone to the Bindiar franc to pay the FB27,000/ton owed for the inventory 45 days\nafter the transaction date. This payment uses the FB/NVK exchange rate of 4.1790 on the\nsettlement date of 15 July 2016.FB 27,000/FB4.1790 per NVK = NVK6,460.88/tonForeign exchange\ngain = Inventory cost \u2013 Cash payment= NVK6,462.58 \u2013 NVK6,460.88= NVK1.70/tonThus, Ambleu's\ncash outflow is less than the cost included in the inventory account, and NVK1.70/ton is the\nrealized foreign exchange gain relating to this transaction. By deferring payment for 45 days,\nand because the Bindiar franc decreased in value during this period, Ambleu pays NVK1.70/ton\nless than the inventory cost on the purchase date of 1 June 2016.

Because the cumulative inflation rate for 2016 and 2017 in Crenland was 128.2\\%, Cendaro\u2019s accounts must first be restated for local inflation. Then, the inflation-restated Crenland guinea financial statements can be translated into Ambleu\u2019s presentation currency, the Norvoltian krone, using the current exchange rate. Using this approach, the cumulative translation loss on 31 December 2017 for the CRG85.17 million patent purchase is -NVK1.58 million, as shown in the following table.\n\n| Date               | Inflation Rate (\\%) | Restated Carrying Value (CRG/MM) | Current Exchange Rate (CRG/NVK) | Translated Amount (NVK/MM) | Annual Translation Gain/Loss (NVK/MM) | Cumulative Translation Gain/Loss (NVK/MM) |\n|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 1 Jan 2016         | ---                 | 85.17                            | 5.6780                          | 15.00                      | N/A                                   | N/A                                         |\n| 31 Dec 2016        | 40.6                | 119.75                           | 8.6702                          | 13.81                      | -1.19                                 | -1.19                                       |\n| 31 Dec 2017        | 62.3                | 194.35                           | 14.4810                         | 13.42                      | -0.39                                 | -1.58                                       |",

            "Adrienne Yu is an analyst with an international bank. She analyzes Ambleu S.A.\n(\u201cAmbleu\u201d), a multinational corporation, for a client presentation. Ambleu complies with\nIFRS, and its presentation currency is the Norvoltian krone (NVK). Ambleu's two subsidiaries,\nNgcorp and Cendar\u00f3, have different functional currencies: Ngcorp uses the Bindiar franc (FB)\nand Cendar\u00f3 uses the Crenland guinea (CRG).Yu first analyzes the following three transactions\nto assess foreign currency transaction exposure:Transaction 1: Cendar\u00f3 sells goods to a non-\ndomestic customer that pays in dollars on the purchase date.Transaction 2: Ngcorp obtains a\nloan in Bindiar francs on 1 June 2016 from a European bank with the Norvoltian krone as its\npresentation currency.Transaction 3: Ambleu imports inventory from Bindiar under 45-day credit\nterms, and the payment is to be denominated in Bindiar francs.Yu then reviews Transactions 2\nand 3. She determines the method that Ambleu would use to translate Transaction 2 into its 31\nDecember 2016 consolidated financial statements. While analyzing Transaction 3, Yu notes that\nAmbleu purchased inventory on 1 June 2016 for FB27,000/ton. Ambleu pays for the inventory on 15\nJuly 2016. Exhibit 1 presents selected economic data for Bindiar and Crenland.\nPrior to reviewing the 2016 and 2017 consolidated financial statements of Ambleu, Yu meets with\nher supervisor, who asks Yu the following two questions:Question 1Would a foreign currency\ntranslation loss reduce Ambleu's net sales growth?Question 2According to IFRS, what disclosures\nshould be included relating to Ambleu's treatment of foreign currency translation for Ngcorp?To\ncomplete her assignment, Yu analyzes selected information and notes from Ambleu's 2016 and 2017\nconsolidated financial statements, presented in Exhibit 2.\nNote 3: The parent company transferred NVK15 million to Cendar\u00f3 on 1 January 2016 to purchase a\npatent from a competitor for CRG85.17 million.Note 4: The 2016 consolidated balance sheet\nincludes Ngcorp's total intangible assets of NVK3 million, which were added to Ngcorp's balance\nsheet on 15 July 2016.\n "
