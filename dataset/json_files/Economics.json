The real interest rate is essentially the real return that consumers/savers demand in\nexchange for postponing consumption. Faster growth in potential GDP means that consumers expect\ntheir real income to rise more rapidly. This implies that an extra unit of future\nincome/consumption is less valuable than it would be if income were expected to grow more\nslowly.

(The bid of 0.23980 is the inverse of the BRL/USD offer, calculated\nas 1/4.1702; the offer of 0.23982 is the inverse of the BRL/USD bid, calculated as 1/4.1698.)\nMultiplying the CHF/USD and USD/BRL bid–offer rates then leads to the interbank implied\nCHF/BRL cross rate:\nBid: 0.9799 × 0.23980 = 0.2349\nOffer: 0.9801 × 0.23982 = 0.23505\nSince the dealer is willing to buy BRL at 0.2355 but BRL can be purchased from the interbank\nmarket at 0.23505, there is an arbitrage opportunity to buy BRL in the interbank market and\nsell BRL to the dealer for a profit of 0.0045 CHF (0.2355 – 0.23505) per BRL transacted.",

        },
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The carry trade involves borrowing in a lower-yielding currency to invest in a\nhigher-yielding\none and netting any profit after allowing for borrowing costs and exchange rate movements. The\nrelevant trade is to borrow USD and lend in euros. To calculate the all-in USD return from a\none-year EUR Libor deposit, first determine the current and one-year-later USD/EUR exchange\nrates. Because one USD buys CAD 1.3200 today and one CAD buys EUR 0.6506 today, today’s\nEUR/USD rate is the product of these two numbers: 1.3200 × 0.6506 = 0.8588. The projected rate\none year later is 1.3151 × 0.6567 = 0.8636. Accordingly, measured in dollars, the investment\nreturn for the unhedged EUR Libor deposit is equal to\n(1.3200 × 0.6506) × (1＋0.022) × [1/(1.3151 × 0.6567)] –1\n= 0.8588 × (1.022) × (1/0.8636) –1 = 1.01632 – 1 = 1.632%\nHowever, the borrowing costs must be charged against this gross return to fund the carry trade\ninvestment (one-year USD Libor was 0.80%). The net return on the carry trade is therefore\n1.632% – 0.80% = 0.832%.",

            "Connor Wagener, a student at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, has been\nasked to prepare a presentation on foreign exchange rates for his International Business\ncourse. Wagener has a basic understanding of exchange rates, but would like a practitioner's\nperspective, and he has arranged an interview with currency trader Hannah McFadden. During the\ninterview, Wagener asks McFadden:“Could you explain what drives exchange rates? I'm curious as\nto why our New Zealand dollar was affected by the European debt crisis in 2011 and what other\nfactors impact it.”In response, McFadden begins with a general discussion of exchange rates.\nShe notes that international parity conditions illustrate how exchange rates are linked to\nexpected inflation, interest rate differences, and forward exchange rates as well as current\nand expected future spot rates. McFadden makes the following statement:Statement 1:\n“Fortunately, the international parity condition most relevant for FX carry trades does not\nalways hold.”McFadden continues her discussion:“FX carry traders go long (i.e. buy) high-\nyield currencies and fund their position by shorting, that is borrowing in, low-yield\ncurrencies. Unfortunately, crashes in currency values can occur which create financial crises\nas traders unwind their positions. For example, in 2008, the New Zealand dollar was negatively\nimpacted when highly leveraged carry trades were unwound. In addition to investors, consumers\nand business owners can also affect currency exchange rates through their impact on their\ncountry's balance of payments. For example, if New Zealand consumers purchase more goods from\nChina than New Zealand businesses sell to China, New Zealand will run a trade account deficit\nwith China.”McFadden further explains:Statement 2:“A trade surplus will tend to cause the\ncurrency of the country in surplus to appreciate while a deficit will cause currency\ndepreciation. Exchange rate changes will result in immediate adjustments in the prices of\ntraded goods as well as in the demand for imports and exports. These changes will immediately\ncorrect the trade imbalance.”McFadden next addresses the influence of monetary and fiscal\npolicy on exchange rates:“Countries also exert significant influence on exchange rates through\nboth the initial mix of their fiscal and monetary policies, and also by subsequent adjustments\nto those policies. Various models have been developed to identify how these policies affect\nexchange rates. The Mundell-Fleming model addresses how changes in both fiscal and monetary\npolicies affect interest rates and ultimately exchange rates in the short-term.”McFadden\ndescribes monetary models by stating:Statement 3:“Monetary models of exchange rate\ndetermination focus on the effects of inflation, price level changes, and risk premium\nadjustments.”McFadden continues her discussion:“So far, we've touched on balance of payments\nand monetary policy. The portfolio-balance model addresses the impacts of sustained fiscal\npolicy on exchange rates. I must take a client call, but will return shortly. In the meantime,\nhere is some relevant literature on the models I mentioned along with a couple of questions for\nyou to consider:Question 1:Assume an emerging market (EM) country has restrictive monetary and\nfiscal policies under low capital mobility conditions. Are these policies likely to lead to\ncurrency appreciation, currency depreciation, or to have no impact?Question 2:Assume a\ndeveloped market (DM) country has an expansive fiscal policy under high capital mobility\nconditions. Why is its currency most likely to depreciate in the long-run under an integrated\nMundell-Fleming and portfolio-balance approach?”Upon her return, Wagener and McFadden review\nthe questions. McFadden notes that capital flows can have a significant impact on exchange\nrates and have contributed to currency crises in both EM and DM countries. She explains that\ncentral banks, like the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, use FX market intervention as a tool to\nmanage exchange rates. McFadden states:Statement 4:“Some studies have found that EM central\nbanks tend to be more effective in using exchange rate intervention than DM central banks,\nprimarily because of one important factor.”McFadden continues her discussion:Statement 5:“I\nmentioned that capital inflows could cause a currency crisis, leaving fund managers with\nsignificant losses.

Wagener has a basic understanding of exchange rates, but would like a practitioner's\nperspective, and he has arranged an interview with currency trader Hannah McFadden. During the\ninterview, Wagener asks McFadden:“Could you explain what drives exchange rates? I'm curious as\nto why our New Zealand dollar was affected by the European debt crisis in 2011 and what other\nfactors impact it.”In response, McFadden begins with a general discussion of exchange rates.\nShe notes that international parity conditions illustrate how exchange rates are linked to\nexpected inflation, interest rate differences, and forward exchange rates as well as current\nand expected future spot rates. McFadden makes the following statement:Statement 1:\n“Fortunately, the international parity condition most relevant for FX carry trades does not\nalways hold.”McFadden continues her discussion:“FX carry traders go long (i.e. buy) high-\nyield currencies and fund their position by shorting, that is borrowing in, low-yield\ncurrencies. Unfortunately, crashes in currency values can occur which create financial crises\nas traders unwind their positions. For example, in 2008, the New Zealand dollar was negatively\nimpacted when highly leveraged carry trades were unwound. In addition to investors, consumers\nand business owners can also affect currency exchange rates through their impact on their\ncountry's balance of payments. For example, if New Zealand consumers purchase more goods from\nChina than New Zealand businesses sell to China, New Zealand will run a trade account deficit\nwith China.”McFadden further explains:Statement 2:“A trade surplus will tend to cause the\ncurrency of the country in surplus to appreciate while a deficit will cause currency\ndepreciation. Exchange rate changes will result in immediate adjustments in the prices of\ntraded goods as well as in the demand for imports and exports. These changes will immediately\ncorrect the trade imbalance.”McFadden next addresses the influence of monetary and fiscal\npolicy on exchange rates:“Countries also exert significant influence on exchange rates through\nboth the initial mix of their fiscal and monetary policies, and also by subsequent adjustments\nto those policies. Various models have been developed to identify how these policies affect\nexchange rates. The Mundell-Fleming model addresses how changes in both fiscal and monetary\npolicies affect interest rates and ultimately exchange rates in the short-term.”McFadden\ndescribes monetary models by stating:Statement 3:“Monetary models of exchange rate\ndetermination focus on the effects of inflation, price level changes, and risk premium\nadjustments.”McFadden continues her discussion:“So far, we've touched on balance of payments\nand monetary policy. The portfolio-balance model addresses the impacts of sustained fiscal\npolicy on exchange rates. I must take a client call, but will return shortly. In the meantime,\nhere is some relevant literature on the models I mentioned along with a couple of questions for\nyou to consider:Question 1:Assume an emerging market (EM) country has restrictive monetary and\nfiscal policies under low capital mobility conditions. Are these policies likely to lead to\ncurrency appreciation, currency depreciation, or to have no impact?Question 2:Assume a\ndeveloped market (DM) country has an expansive fiscal policy under high capital mobility\nconditions. Why is its currency most likely to depreciate in the long-run under an integrated\nMundell-Fleming and portfolio-balance approach?”Upon her return, Wagener and McFadden review\nthe questions. McFadden notes that capital flows can have a significant impact on exchange\nrates and have contributed to currency crises in both EM and DM countries. She explains that\ncentral banks, like the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, use FX market intervention as a tool to\nmanage exchange rates. McFadden states:Statement 4:“Some studies have found that EM central\nbanks tend to be more effective in using exchange rate intervention than DM central banks,\nprimarily because of one important factor.”McFadden continues her discussion:Statement 5:“I\nmentioned that capital inflows could cause a currency crisis, leaving fund managers with\nsignificant losses. In the period leading up to a currency crisis, I would predict that an\naffected country's:Prediction 1: foreign exchange reserves will increase.Prediction 2: broad\nmoney growth in nominal and real terms will increase.Prediction 3: real exchange rate will be\nsubstantially higher than its mean level during tranquil periods.After the interview, McFadden\nagrees to meet the following week to discuss more recent events on the New Zealand dollar.\n "
