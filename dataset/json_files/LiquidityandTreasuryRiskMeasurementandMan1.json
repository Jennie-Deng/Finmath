The bank has\nclassified its checking, savings, and nonperson time deposits (which total $380.0 million in\ndeposits) into three categories: hot money, vulnerable, and stable (aka, core) funds:\n \n \nThe total liquidity requirement is the sum of the liability and loan requirements, but we are\nhere ignoring the loan liquidity requirement; further, the reserve requirements are not\nnecessarily realistic but instead are rounded for the sake of more convenient calculations.\nManagement has elected to hold an 80.0% reserve in liquid assets or borrowing capacity for each\ndollar of hot money deposits, a 50.0% reserve behind vulnerable deposits, and a 20.0% reserve\nfor its holdings of core funds. The legal reserve requirement is 10.0% for both checkable and\nsavings deposits; nonpersonal time deposits have zero legal reserve requirements. Kingstreet\nSavings is using the Structure of Funds approach to estimating its liquidity requirement. What\nis Kingstreet's net deposit liquidity requirement for the (total of) vulnerable funds?",

Repo loans are\nsecured by collateral, which makes the lender much less vulnerable to a decline in the\ncreditworthiness of the borrower. Collateral haircuts are important in mitigating liquidity\nrisk in repo transactions. The lender is exposed to the risk of the value of the collateral\ndeclining during the repo term, which can be mitigated by requiring (higher) haircut values,\nthat is, discounts to the value of the posted collateral.抵押品是减轻交易对手信用风险的重要手段\n。 回购贷款以抵押品作抵押，这使贷方不易受到借款人信用度下降的影响。 减少抵押品对于降低回购交易\n中的流动性风险很重要。 贷方在回购期内面临抵押品价值下降的风险，这可以通过要求（较高）折扣（即贴\n现抵押品）来减轻。",

As Hull explains about the NSFR, \"The numerator is calculated by\nmultiplying each category of funding (capital, wholesale deposits, retail deposits, etc.) by an\navailable stable funding (ASF) factor, reflecting their stability (see Table 16.4). The\ndenominator is calculated from the assets and off-balance‐sheet items requiring funding. Each\ncategory of these is multiplied by a required stable funding (RSF) factor to reflect the\npermanence of the funding (see Table 16.5). The implementation date for the NSFR requirement is\nJanuary 1, 2018.\" Therefore, the numerator of the NSFR includes regulatory capital as a stable\nfunding source. In regard to false (C), the LCR refers to the asset side of the balance sheet:\nLCR = (high-quality liquid assets; a.ka., HQLA) / (Net cash outflows in a 30-day period), and\nit should exceed 100.0%NSFR等于（稳定资金额/所需稳定资金量），并且应超过100.0％。 正如赫尔\n（Hull）关于NSFR的解释，“分子的计算方法是将每种类别的资金（资本，批发存款，零售存款等）乘以可\n用的稳定资金（ASF）因子，以反映其稳定性（请参见表16.4）。 分母是从需要资金的资产和表外项目中计\n算出来的，每个类别都乘以所需的稳定资金（RSF）因子即可反映出资金的持久性（见表16.5）。NSFR要求的\n实施日期为2018年1月1日。” 因此，NSFR的分子包括监管资本作为稳定的资金来源。 关于错误选项\n（C），LCR是指资产负债表的资产方：LCR =（高质量流动资产；又称HQLA）/（30天期间的现金净流出\n），以及 它应该超过100.0％",

Therefore, the cost to unwind\nthe portfolio is (300.00 + 680.00)/2 = $490.00.第一个持仓的买入-卖出价差为0.030 * 10,000 = $\n300.00； 第二个持仓买入-卖出价差为0.040 * 17,000 = $ 680.00。 因此，平仓投资组合的成本为\n（300.00＋680.00）/ 2 = $ 490.00。",

Recall that an ideal benchmark is tradeable, and alpha is measured relative to\ntradeable benchmarks. But Ang says \"No investor receives the returns on illiquid indexes. An\nasset owner never receives the NCREIF return on a real estate portfolio, for example. The same\nis true for most hedge fund indexes and private equity indexes. In liquid public markets, large\ninvestors can receive index market returns and pay close to zero in fees. In contrast, NCREIF\nis not investable as it is impossible to buy all the underlying properties in that index.\"玛丽\n可能不是FRM持证人。 Ang认为，与非流动性资产类别相关的一个关键区别是无法将因素风险与管理者的技能\n区分开（“非流动性资产的类别没有市场指数”），因此投资经理的才能非常重要。 试想一下，理想的基准\n是可以交易的，并且alpha是相对于可交易的基准进行衡量的。 但Ang说：“没有投资者可以在非流动性指数\n获利。比如，资产所有者从未获得房地产投资组合的NCREIF收益。大多数对冲基金指数和私募股权指数也是\n如此。在流动性公开市场，大型投资者可以获得指数市场的回报，并且几乎不需要支付费用。相反，投资者\n无法对NCREIF进行投资，因为不可能购买该指数含有的所有基础资产。”",

        "explanation": "Malz on systemic funding liquidity risk: \"The funding liquidity risk in corporate\ntransactions is both idiosyncratic and systematic. Funding for a particular LBO or merger might\nfall through, even if the deal would otherwise have been consummated. But funding conditions\ngenerally can change adversely. This occurred in mid-2007 as the subprime crisis took hold.\nMany LBO and merger deals fell apart as financing came to a halt. Banks also incurred losses on\ninventories of syndicated loans, called “hung loans,” that had not yet been distributed to\nother investors or into completed securitizations, as noted in Chapter 9. As risk aversion and\ndemand for liquidity increased, the appetite for these loans dried up, and their prices fell\nsharply. Apart from providers of financing, other participants in these transactions, such as\nhedge funds involved in merger arbitrage, also experienced losses. Mergers typically result in\nan increase in the target acquisition price, though not usually all the way to the announced\nacquisition price, and in a decrease in the acquirer’s price, since the acquirer often takes\non additional debt to finance the acquisition. Merger arbitrage exploits the remaining gap\nbetween the current and announced prices. The risk arises from uncertainty as to whether the\ntransactions will be closed. In the early stages of the subprime crisis, merger arbitrage\nstrategies generated large losses as merger plans were abandoned for lack of financing.\nInvestors taking on exposure to such transactions are therefore exposed not only to the\nidiosyncratic risk of the deal, but to the systematic risk posed by credit and funding\nconditions generally. This risk factor is hard to relate to any particular time series of asset\nreturns. Rather, it is a “soft factor,” on which information must be gathered from disparate\nsources ranging from credit and liquidity spreads to quantitative and anecdotal data on credit\navailability.马尔茨谈到系统性的融资流动性风险：“公司交易中的融资流动性风险既既特殊又系统化。即\n使交易能够达成，对特定的杠杆收购或合并的融资也可能会失败。但是融资条件通常会发生不利变化。这种\n情况发生在2007年中期，次贷危机爆发后，由于融资停止，许多杠杆收购和合并交易分崩离析；银行也蒙受\n了尚未分配给“银团贷款”和已完成证券化的银团贷款库存的损失（如第9章所述）。随着风险规避和对流动\n性的需求增加，这些贷款的需求枯竭，其价格急剧下跌。 除了融资提供者以外，这些交易的其他参与者，例\n如参与合并套利的对冲基金，也遭受了损失。合并通常会导致目标收购价格提高，通常不会高到到宣布的收\n购价格。而且合并会导致收购价格降低，因为收购方通常会承担更多债务以为收购融资。合并套利利用了当\n前价格和宣布价格之间的剩余差距。风险来自交易能够达成的不确定性。在次贷危机的初期，由于缺乏融资\n而放弃了合并计划，合并套利策略造成了巨大损失。因此，承担此类交易风险的投资者不仅面临交易的特殊\n风险，而且还面临信贷和融资环境带来的系统性风险。这个风险因素很难与资产回报的任何特定时间序列关\n联。相反，这是一个“软因素”，必须从不同的来源收集信息，范围从信贷和流动性利差到大量数据和传闻\n。 系统性的资金流动性风险无处不在。其他对融资环境的“潜在”因素敏感的资产类型或策略包括房地产\n，可转换债券和统计套利。房地产是寿命最长的资产之一。因此，按揭（由房地产抵押的贷款）一般是长期\n摊销的固定利率贷款。例如，典型的房屋抵押贷款是一种30年期的固定利率贷款。当贷款惯例背离该标准且\n短期贷款占主导地位时，贷方和借款人都面临资金流动性风险，因为借款人除非能够再融资，否则不太可能\n偿还。这种风险主要是系统性的，因为它可能同时影响所有借方和贷方。”",

The concepts at play are similar to those of a depositor run at a commercial bank.\nThat is, fears over the solvency of the bank lead others to act so as to reduce their potential\nlosses in the event of the bank’s default. Unlike insured depositors at a commercial bank,\nmany of those with exposures to dealer banks have no default insurance, or do not wish to bear\nthe frictional costs of involvement in the bank’s failure procedures even if they do have\ninsurance. The key mechanisms that lead to the failure of a dealer bank are the flight of\nshort-term creditors, the departures of prime-brokerage clients, various cash-draining actions\nby derivatives counterparties that are designed to lower their exposures to the dealer bank,\nand finally and most decisively, the loss of clearing-bank privileges.\" In regard to these\nfailure mechanisms, which of the following statements is TRUE?",

As Fabozzi explains, \"Investors holding cash for liquidity or\nsafekeeping purposes often find investing in repo to be an ideal solution. The most significant\nexample of this is the money market mutual fund industry, which invests on behalf of investors\nwilling to accept relatively low returns in exchange for liquidity and safety. [A money market\nfund would lend money while taking collateral and then, at maturity, collect the loan plus\ninterest and return the collateral.] Holding collateral makes the lender less vulnerable to the\ncreditworthiness of a counterparty because, in the event of a default by the counterparty, the\ninvestor (e.g., the money market fund) can sell the repo collateral to recover any amounts\nowed. In summary, relative to super-safe and liquid non-interest-bearing bank deposits, repo\ninvestments pay a short-term rate without sacrificing much liquidity or incurring significant\ndefault risk.\" Given this motivation, Rankcon understandably employs each of the following\ncriteria (or preference) with respect to its repo investments EXCEPT which is the LEAST likely\npreference?",

For this reason these investors are said to\naccept general collateral, which trades at general collateral repo rates. The types and\ndetermination of repo rates are discussed later in this chapter.\"“回购投资者虽然在乎所接受抵押\n品的质量，但通常并不要求特定债券。因此，尽管回购投资者可能会非常在乎他们将选择哪种证券作为抵押\n品，例如期限少于五年的欧元区域政府债券，但他们不会坚持要求该类别下的某种特定证券，因此，这些投\n资者接受以一般抵押品回购利率交易的一般抵押品。",
