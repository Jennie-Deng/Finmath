The portfolio factor exposures, risk contributions, and risk characteristics are\npresented in Exhibits 2 and 3.\n \nChen and Garcia next discuss characteristics of long–short and long-only investing. Garcia\nmakes the following statements about investing with long–short and long-only managers:\nStatement 1: A long–short portfolio allows for a gross exposure of 100%.\nStatement 2: A long-only portfolio generally allows for greater investment capacity than other\napproaches, particularly when using strategies that focus on large-cap stocks.\nChen and Garcia then turn their attention to portfolio management approaches. Chen prefers an\napproach that emphasizes security-specific factors, engages in factor timing, and typically\nleads to portfolios that are generally more concentrated than those built using a systematic\napproach.\n "

Conflicts of interest can result for a company. For example, a portfolio manager\ncould engage with a company that also happens to be an investor in the manager’s portfolio.

Therefore, the DoGood Fund may be a free-rider on the\nactivism by these shareholders.\nNote 4: Of the four funds, the Elmer Fund is most likely to appeal to investors who want to\nminimize fees and believe that the market is efficient.\nNote 5: Adding investment-grade bonds to the Elmer Fund will decrease the portfolio’s short-\nterm risk.\nSmith discusses means of enhancing income for the three funds with the junior analyst, Kolton\nFrey, including engaging in securities lending or writing covered calls. Frey tells Smith the\nfollowing:\nStatement 1: Securities lending would increase income through reinvestment of the cash\ncollateral but would require the fund to miss out on dividend income from the lent securities.\nStatement 2: Writing covered calls would generate income, but doing so would limit the upside\nshare price appreciation for the underlying shares.\n "

        "explanation": "B is correct. Writing covered calls also generates additional income for an equity\nportfolio, but doing so limits the upside from share price appreciation of the underlying\nshares. Therefore, Statement 2 is correct. A is incorrect because dividends on loaned stock are\n“manufactured” by the stock borrower for the stock lender—that is, the stock borrower\nensures that the stock lender is compensated for any dividends that the lender would have\nreceived had the stock not been loaned. Therefore, Statement 1 is incorrect. Frey is incorrect\nin stating that the funds would miss out on dividend income on lent securities.",

Sector deviations from the benchmark\nof 10% or more are common and are usually maintained for 12 to 24 months. At the same time,\nsector managers at Furlings use their expertise in dissecting financial statements and their\nunderstanding of the corporate branding and competitive landscape within sectors to build\nequally weighted baskets of securities within sectors. Each basket contains their 7 to 10\nhighest-conviction securities, favoring firms that have good governance, strong growth\npotential, competitive advantages such as branding, and attractive relative valuations. The\nFurlings master fund holds approximately 90 securities.Asgard: Asgard Investment Partners is a\nvery large asset manager. It believes in investing in firms that have a strong business model\nand governance, reasonable valuations, solid capital structures with limited financial\nleverage, and above-average expected earnings growth for the next three years. Although the\nAsgard master fund invests in fewer than 125 securities, each sector analyst builds financial\nmodels that track as many as 50 firms. To support them in their task, analysts benefit from\nsoftware developed by the Asgard research and technology group that provides access to detailed\nmarket and accounting information on 5,000 global firms, allowing for the calculation of many\nvaluation and growth metrics and precise modeling of sources of cash-flow strengths and\nweaknesses within each business. Asgard analysts can also use the application to back-test\nstrategies and build their own models to rank securities’ attractiveness according to their\npreferred characteristics. Security allocation is determined by a management team but depends\nheavily on a quantitative risk model developed by Asgard. Asgard has a low portfolio\nturnover.Tokra: Tokra Capital uses a factor-based strategy to rank securities from most\nattractive to least attractive. Each security is scored based on three metrics: price to book\nvalue (P/B), 12-month increase in stock price, and return on assets. Tokra’s managers have a\nstrong risk management background. Their objective is to maximize their exposure to the most\nattractive securities using a total scoring approach subject to limiting single-security\nconcentration below 2%, sector deviations below 3%, active risk below 4%, and annual turnover\nless than 40%, while having a market beta close to 1. The master fund holds approximately 400\npositions out of a possible universe of more than 2,000 securities evaluated.\nWhen Leonard’s analysts met with Asgard, they inquired whether its managers engage in activist\ninvesting because Asgard’s portfolio frequently holds significant positions, because of their\nlarge asset size, and because of their emphasis on strong governance and their ability to model\nsources of cash-flow strengths and weaknesses within each business. The manager indicated that\nAsgard engages with companies from a long-term shareholder’s perspective, which is consistent\nwith the firm’s low portfolio turnover, and uses its voice, and its vote, on matters that can\ninfluence companies’ long-term value.Leonard wants to confirm that each manager’s portfolios\nare consistent with its declared style.

Furlings combines a top-down and bottom-up approach, but in both\ncases, the allocation process is significantly determined according to the managers’\ndiscretion and judgement. There is a strong emphasis on understanding financial reporting, and\nthe sector managers focus on a relatively small number for firms. They also extend their\nanalysis to other areas associated with fundamental management, such as valuation, competitive\nadvantages, and governance. Finally, Furlings’s top-down process depends largely on the views\nand experience of its head manager.B is incorrect. Asgard has many of the attributes associated\nwith a fundamental manager. It invests in a relatively small number of securities and focuses\non the companies’ business model, valuations, and future growth prospects. Because of the\nscope of the securities coverage by each manager, however, Asgard depends heavily on technology\nand tools to support screening and ranking of securities attractiveness. Each manager can use\nhis judgement to build his own quantitative models. Furthermore, the allocation process,\nalthough overlaid by a management team, also depends heavily on technology. Asgard has\ncharacteristics of both fundamental and quantitative managers.C is incorrect. Tokra exhibits\nthe characteristics of a quantitative manager. The firm uses quantitative metrics to rank\nsecurities based on valuation, profitability, and momentum criteria and uses portfolio\noptimization to determine the final allocation. Tokra holds many positions typical of\nquantitative approaches.",

Sector deviations from the benchmark\nof 10% or more are common and are usually maintained for 12 to 24 months. At the same time,\nsector managers at Furlings use their expertise in dissecting financial statements and their\nunderstanding of the corporate branding and competitive landscape within sectors to build\nequally weighted baskets of securities within sectors. Each basket contains their 7 to 10\nhighest-conviction securities, favoring firms that have good governance, strong growth\npotential, competitive advantages such as branding, and attractive relative valuations. The\nFurlings master fund holds approximately 90 securities.Asgard: Asgard Investment Partners is a\nvery large asset manager. It believes in investing in firms that have a strong business model\nand governance, reasonable valuations, solid capital structures with limited financial\nleverage, and above-average expected earnings growth for the next three years. Although the\nAsgard master fund invests in fewer than 125 securities, each sector analyst builds financial\nmodels that track as many as 50 firms. To support them in their task, analysts benefit from\nsoftware developed by the Asgard research and technology group that provides access to detailed\nmarket and accounting information on 5,000 global firms, allowing for the calculation of many\nvaluation and growth metrics and precise modeling of sources of cash-flow strengths and\nweaknesses within each business. Asgard analysts can also use the application to back-test\nstrategies and build their own models to rank securities’ attractiveness according to their\npreferred characteristics. Security allocation is determined by a management team but depends\nheavily on a quantitative risk model developed by Asgard.

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C is the correct answer. Tokra indicates that it emphasizes three metrics: P/B, 12-\nmonth price momentum, and return on assets. Although the portfolio consists of securities that\nhave stronger momentum than those of the index on average, and although the ratio of net income\nto assets is also favorable, the average P/B is somehow higher than that of the index. Although\nthis scenario could normally be explained by an emphasis on specific sectors with a higher P/B\nthan other sectors, the low level of sector deviation tolerated within the strategy weakens\nthat explanation. This should be explored with Tokra’s managers.A is an incorrect answer.\nFurlings is a top-down sector rotator with a value orientation within sectors. The lower P/B\nand P/E and higher net income over assets are consistent with a relative value orientation.\nBecause Furlings can take significant positions in specific sectors, however, there could be\nother circumstances in which the portfolio would have a higher P/B and/or P/E and or a lower\nnet income /assets than the index if the fund were to emphasize sectors having such\ncharacteristics. Yet, this would not necessarily imply that the firm does not favor the most\nattractive relative valuations within sectors.B is an incorrect answer. Asgard invests in firms\nthat offer reasonable valuations and above-average expected cash flow growth during the next\nthree years. The data, such as P/B and average expected three-year profit growth, are\nconsistent with its declared style. Again, it is not necessarily inconsistent to emphasize\nthese aspects while investing in a portfolio that has a lower dividend yield, slightly higher\nP/E, and lower price momentum.",

The value score is subtracted from the\ngrowth score. A strongly positive net score leads to a growth classification, and a strongly\nnegative score leads to a value classification. A score relatively close to zero indicates a\ncore classification. To achieve a blend classification, the portfolio must have a balanced\nexposure to stocks classified as value and growth, a dominant exposure to stocks classified as\ncore, or a combination of both.A is an incorrect answer. Both Morningstar and Lipper classify\nindividual stocks in a specific style category. Neither assumes a security can belong to\nseveral styles in specific proportion. B is an incorrect answer. The Lipper methodology does\nhave a core classification. It sums the Z-score of six portfolio characteristics over several\nyears to determine an overall Z-score that determines either a value, core, or growth\nclassification.",
