Generally, the bank’s decisions of making loans or not is independent among\nborrowers, but not independent in a recessionary condition. In normal conditions, Jamison has a\nprobability of 70% to get the mortgage successfully, and Bronson has a probability of 80%.\nWhile in the recessionary economy, the bank is going to reduce the loan scale. Thus, Jamison\nwould have a lower probability of 30%, and Bronson would have a rate of 35%. Based on the\ninformation above, Jamison makes three statements:Statement 1: There is a probability of 56%\nthat both of them could get mortgages from the bank generally.Statement 2: Because the bank’s\ndecisions of making loans are unconditionally independent, hence they must be conditionally\nindependent.Statement 3: There is a probability of 10.5% that they could get mortgages from the\nbank when the economy is in recession.How many of the statements above is(are) correct?",
