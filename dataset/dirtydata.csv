13,6,,,"A two-year floating-rate note pays 6-month Libor plus 80 basis points. The floater is priced
at 97 per 100 of par value. Current 6-month Libor is 1.00%. Assume a 30/360 day-count
convention and evenly spaced periods. The discount margin for the floater in basis points (bps)
is closest to:",,"{'A': '180 bps.', 'B': '236 bps.', 'C': '420 bps.'}",B,"B is correct. The discount or required margin is 236 basis points. Given the
floater has a maturity of two years and is linked to 6-month Libor, the formula for calculating
discount margin is:

B是正确的。折现率差为236个基点。鉴于浮动利率的到期日为两年，且与6个月伦敦银行同业拆借利率挂钩
，计算折现率差的公式为：

Substituting given values in:

$$
97 = \frac{(0.01 + 0.0080) \times 100}{2 \left(1 + \frac{0.01 + DM}{2}\right)^1} + \frac{(0.01 + 0.0080) \times 100}{2 \left(1 + \frac{0.01 + DM}{2}\right)^2} + \dots + \frac{(0.01 + 0.0080) \times 100}{2 \left(1 + \frac{0.01 + DM}{2}\right)^4} + 100
$$

$$
97 = \frac{0.90}{\left(1 + \frac{0.01 + DM}{2}\right)^1} + \frac{0.90}{\left(1 + \frac{0.01 + DM}{2}\right)^2} + \frac{0.90}{\left(1 + \frac{0.01 + DM}{2}\right)^3} + \frac{0.90 + 100}{\left(1 + \frac{0.01 + DM}{2}\right)^4}
$$

To calculate $DM$, begin by solving for the discount rate per period:

$$
97 = \frac{0.90}{(1+r)^1} + \frac{0.90}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{0.90}{(1+r)^3} + \frac{0.90 + 100}{(1+r)^4}
$$

$$
r = 0.0168
$$

Now, solve for $DM$:

$$
\frac{0.01 + DM}{2} = 0.0168
$$

$$
DM = 0.0236

1137,7,"Megan Beade and Hanna Müller are senior analysts for a large, multi-divisional money
management firm. Beade supports the institutional portfolio managers, and Müller does the same
for the private wealth portfolio managers.Beade reviews the asset allocation in Exhibit 1,
derived from a mean–variance optimization (MVO) model for an institutional client, noting that
details of the MVO are lacking.
The firm’s policy is to rebalance a portfolio when the asset class weight falls outside of a
corridor around the target allocation. The width of each corridor is customized for each client
and proportional to the target allocation. Beade recommends wider corridor widths for high-risk
asset classes, narrower corridor widths for less liquid asset classes, and narrower corridor
widths for taxable clients with high capital gains tax rates.One client sponsors a defined
benefit pension plan where the present value of the liabilities is $241 million and the market
value of plan assets is $205 million. Beade expects interest rates to rise and both the present
value of plan liabilities and the market value of plan assets to decrease by $25 million,
changing the pension plan’s funding ratio.Beade uses a surplus optimization approach to
liability-relative asset allocation based on the objective functionU_m^LR=E(Rs,m) -

Client Haunani Kealoha has a large fixed obligation due in 10 years. Beade assesses that
Kealoha has substantially more funds than are required to meet the fixed obligation. The client
wants to earn a competitive risk-adjusted rate of return while maintaining a high level of
certainty that there will be sufficient assets to meet the fixed obligation.In the private
wealth area, the firm has designed five subportfolios with differing asset allocations that are
used to fund different client goals over a five-year horizon. Exhibit 3 shows the expected
returns and volatilities of the subportfolios and the probabilities that the subportfolios will
exceed an expected minimum return. Client Luis Rodríguez wants to satisfy two goals. Goal 1
requires a conservative portfolio providing the highest possible minimum return that will be
met at least 95% of the time. Goal 2 requires a riskier portfolio that provides the highest
minimum return that will be exceeded at least 85% of the time.
Müller uses a risk parity asset allocation approach with a client’s four–asset class
portfolio. The expected return of the domestic bond asset class is the lowest of the asset
classes, and the returns of the domestic bond asset class have the lowest covariance with other
asset class returns. Müller estimates the weight that should be placed on domestic bonds.Müller
and a client discuss other approaches to asset allocation that are not based on optimization
models or goals-based models. Müller makes the following comments to the client:
Comment 1：An advantage of the “120 minus your age” heuristic over the 60/40 stock/bond
heuristic is that it incorporates an age-based stock/bond allocation.
Comment 2:The Yale model emphasizes traditional investments and a commitment to active
management.
Comment 3:A client’s asset allocation using the 1/N rule depends on the investment
characteristics of each asset class.

In this example, there are four asset classes, and the variance of the total portfolio is assumed to be 25%; therefore, using a risk parity approach, the allocation to each asset class is expected to contribute $ (1/4 \times 25\%) = 6.25\% $ of the total variance.

1154,1,"Ayanna Chen is a portfolio manager at Aycrig Fund, where she supervises assistant
portfolio manager Mordechai Garcia. Aycrig Fund invests money for high-net-worth and
institutional investors. Chen asks Garcia to analyze certain information relating to Aycrig
Fund's three sub-managers, Managers A, B, and C.Manager A has $250 million in assets under
management (AUM), an active risk of 5%, an information coefficient of 0.15, and a transfer
coefficient of 0.40. Manager A's portfolio has a 2.5% expected active return this year.Chen
directs Garcia to determine the maximum position size that Manager A can hold in shares of
Pasliant Corporation, which has a market capitalization of $3.0 billion, an index weight of
0.20%, and an average daily trading volume (ADV) of 1% of its market capitalization.Manager A
has the following position size policy constraints:
■Allocation: No investment in any security may represent more than 3% of total AUM.
■Liquidity: No position size may represent more than 10% of the dollar value of the security's
ADV.
■Index weight: The maximum position weight must be less than or equal to 10 times the
security's weight in the index.Manager B holds a highly diversified portfolio that has balanced
exposures to rewarded risk factors, high active share, and a relatively low active risk
target.Selected data on Manager C's portfolio, which contains three assets, is presented in
Exhibit 1.
Chen considers adding a fourth sub-manager and evaluates three managers' portfolios, Portfolios
X, Y, and Z. The managers for Portfolios X, Y, and Z all have similar costs, fees, and alpha
skills, and their factor exposures align with both Aycrig's and investors' expectations and
constraints. The portfolio factor exposures, risk contributions, and risk characteristics are
presented in Exhibits 2 and 3.
 
Chen and Garcia next discuss characteristics of long–short and long-only investing. Garcia
makes the following statements about investing with long–short and long-only managers:
Statement 1: A long–short portfolio allows for a gross exposure of 100%.
Statement 2: A long-only portfolio generally allows for greater investment capacity than other
approaches, particularly when using strategies that focus on large-cap stocks.
Chen and Garcia then turn their attention to portfolio management approaches. Chen prefers an
approach that emphasizes security-specific factors, engages in factor timing, and typically
leads to portfolios that are generally more concentrated than those built using a systematic
approach.

foundation’s board of directors hired a consultant, Stacy McMahon, to analyze performance and
provide recommendations.McMahon meets with Autumn Laubach, the foundation’s executive
director, to review the existing asset allocation strategy. Laubach believes the portfolio’s
underperformance is attributable to the equity holdings, which are allocated 55% to a US large-
capitalization index fund, 30% to an actively managed US small-cap fund, and 15% to an actively
managed developed international fund.Laubach states that the board is interested in following a

approaches that could generate returns in excess of the benchmark for part of the equity
allocation. McMahon suggests that the board consider following a passive factor-based momentum
strategy for the allocation to international stocks.McMahon observes that the benchmark used
for the US large-cap equity component is a price-weighted index containing 150 stocks. The

2014,16,"Silvia Abram and Walter Edgarton are analysts with Cefrino Investments, which sponsors
the Cefrino Sovereign Bond Fund (the Fund). Abram and Edgarton recently attended an investment
committee meeting where interest rate expectations for the next 12 months were discussed. The
Fund’s mandate allows its duration to fluctuate ±0.30 per year from the benchmark duration.
The Fund’s duration is currently equal to its benchmark. Although the Fund is presently
invested entirely in annual coupon sovereign bonds, its investment policy also allows
investments in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and call options on government bond futures.
The Fund’s current holdings of on-the-run bonds are presented in Exhibit 1.
Over the next 12 months, Abram expects a stable yield curve; however, Edgarton expects a
steepening yield curve, with short-term yields rising by 1.00% and long-term yields rising by
more than 1.00%.Based on her yield curve forecast, Abram recommends to her supervisor changes
to the Fund’s holdings using the following three strategies:Strategy 1: Sell the 3-year
bonds, and use the proceeds to buy 10-year bonds.Strategy 2: Sell the 5-year bonds, and use
the proceeds to buy 30-year MBS with an effective duration of 4.75.Strategy 3: Sell the 10-
year bonds, and buy call options on 10-year government bond futures.Abram’s supervisor
disagrees with Abram’s yield curve outlook. The supervisor develops two alternative portfolio
scenarios based on her own yield curve outlook:Scenario 1 Sell all bonds in the Fund except
the 2-year and 30-year bonds, and increase positions in these two bonds while keeping duration
neutral to the benchmark.Scenario 2 Construct a condor to benefit from less curvature in the
5-year to 10-year area of the yield curve. The condor will utilize the same 1-year, 5-year, 10-
year, and 30-year bonds held in the Fund. The maximum allowable position in the 30-year bond in
the condor is $17million,and the bonds must have equal (absolute value) money duration.Edgarton
evaluates the Fund’s positions from Exhibit 1 along with two of his pro forma portfolios,
which are summarized in Exhibit 2:
Lastly, Edgarton reviews a separate account for Cefrino’s US clients that invest in Australian
government bonds. He expects a stable Australian yield curve over the next 12 months. He
evaluates the return from buying and holding a 1-year Australian government bond versus buying
the 2-year Australian government bond and selling it in one year.

2027,29,"Sanober Hirji is a junior analyst with Northco Securities, which is based in Canada.
The institutional clients of Northco are active investors in Canadian coupon-bearing government
bonds. Client portfolios are benchmarked to a Canadian government bond index, which is a
diverse maturity index portfolio. After reviewing the portfolio of a French institutional
client, Hirji evaluates yield curve strategies for Canadian government bond portfolios under
various interest rate scenarios. Hirji’s supervisor, éliane Prégent, forecasts that Canadian
long-term rates will rise and short-term rates will fall over the next 12 months.In contrast,
Northco’s chief economist forecasts that Canadian interest rates will increase or decrease by
100 basis points over the next 12 months. Based on the chief economist’s forecast, Hirji
suggests increasing the convexity of the French institutional client’s portfolio by selling
10-year bonds and investing the proceeds in a duration-matched barbell position of Canadian
government 3-year and long-term bonds. She notes that the duration of the 10-year bonds, along
with the durations of the other portfolio bonds, aligns the portfolio’s effective duration
with that of the benchmark. Selected data on Canadian government bonds are presented in Exhibit
1.
(* There is no single convention for how convexity numbers are presented; for example,
Bloomberg has historically followed a convention of dividing the “raw” convexity number by
100 (as presented here). However, it is important to use the raw convexity number when
estimating returns.)Hirji then considers a strategy to sell some long-term bonds from the
French institutional client’s portfolio and purchase short maturity at-the-money options on
long-term bond futures. The portfolio’s duration would remain unchanged. Prégent asks:“How
would portfolio performance be affected by this strategy if the yield curve were to remain
stable?”Hirji also proposes the following duration-neutral trades for the French institutional
client:
Long/short trade on 1-year and 3-year Canadian government bonds
Short/long trade on 10-year and long-term Canadian government bonds
Six months later, Hirji reviews Canadian government bonds for a Malaysian institutional client.
Prégent and Hirji expect changes in the curvature of the yield curve but are not sure whether
curvature will increase or decrease. Hirji first analyzes positions that would profit from an
increase in the curvature of the yield curve. The positions must be duration neutral, and the
maximum position that the Malaysian client can take in long-term bonds is C$150 million. Hirji
notes that interest rates have increased by 100 basis points over the past six months. Selected
data for on-the-run Canadian government bonds are shown in Exhibit 2.
Hirji then considers the scenario where the yield curve will lose curvature for the Malaysian
institutional client. She notes that a 7-year Canadian government bond is also available in the
market. Hirji proposes a duration-neutral portfolio comprised of 47% in 5-year bonds and 53% in
7-year bonds.Finally, Hirji uses the components of expected returns to compare the performance
of a bullet portfolio and a barbell portfolio for a British institutional client.
Characteristics of these portfolios are shown in Exhibit 3.

fixed-income allocation includes a domestic (US) bond portfolio and an externally managed
global bond portfolio.The domestic bond portfolio has a total return mandate, which specifies a
long-term return objective of 25 basis points (bps) over the benchmark index. Relative to the
benchmark, small deviations in sector weightings are permitted, such risk factors as duration
must closely match, and tracking error is expected to be less than 50 bps per year.The
objectives for the domestic bond portfolio include the ability to fund future liabilities,
protect interest income from short-term inflation, and minimize the correlation with the
fund’s equity portfolio. The correlation between the fund’s domestic bond portfolio and
equity portfolio is currently 0.14. Deveraux plans to reduce the fund’s equity allocation and
increase the allocation to the domestic bond portfolio. She reviews two possible investment
strategies.Strategy 1 Purchase AAA rated fixed-coupon corporate bonds with a modified duration
of two years and a correlation coefficient with the equity portfolio of –0.15.Strategy
2 Purchase US government agency floating-coupon bonds with a modified duration of one month

and always sell them before selling bonds that are viewed as fairly valued or
undervalued.Statement 2 Taxable investors should never intentionally realize capital
losses.Regarding the purchase of corporate bonds, Foster collects relevant data, which are
presented in Exhibit 1
Deveraux and Foster review the total expected 12-month return (assuming no reinvestment income)
for the global bond portfolio. Selected financial data are presented in Exhibit 2.
Deveraux contemplates adding a new manager to the global bond portfolio. She reviews three
proposals and determines that each manager uses the same index as its benchmark but pursues a
different total return approach, as presented in Exhibit 3.

题目中告诉我们，standard error of the estimate，也就是SEE =se= 1.8618987 根据基础班讲义中的
Sf的公式，如下图:

$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^2 = 4.285714 \times 7 = 30.
$

$
s_f = 1.8618987 \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{(5 - 7.5)^2}{30}} = 2.1499.
$

因此，只需要计算出根号部分的数值后，带入SEE即可求出Sf 

题目中还告诉了variance
of RDR=[Σ(Xi－X拔 )^2 ]/(n-1)=4.285714，n=8，因此可以得出：Σ(Xi－X拔 )^2=4.285714×7=30所以
