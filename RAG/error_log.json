    },
    "Answer": "A",
    "Explanation": "Portfolio 1 is not efficient because it has a lower expected return and higher risk than Portfolios 2, 3, and 4. The portfolio is not mean variance efficient due to its suboptimal risk-return profile.",

    "Wrong_reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: I focused on finding the portfolio with the highest return for the least risk, which led me to select Portfolio 2 as the best choice.",
        "Step 2: I incorrectly interpreted the question as asking for the most efficient portfolio, rather than identifying the suboptimal one.",
        "Step 3: I did not apply the concept of mean-variance efficiency correctly, as Portfolio 1 has both a lower return and higher risk than Portfolios 2 and 3."

            "### Step 1. Understanding the Problem",
            "We are provided with the expected returns and standard deviations of four portfolios. The goal is to determine which portfolio is not mean-variance efficient, meaning it does not provide the best trade-off between risk and return.",
            "### Step 2. Key Data",
            "From the table:",
            "- Portfolio 1: Expected Return = 10%, Standard Deviation = 14%",
            "- Portfolio 2: Expected Return = 12%, Standard Deviation = 13%",
            "- Portfolio 3: Expected Return = 11%, Standard Deviation = 12%",
            "- Portfolio 4: Expected Return = 14%, Standard Deviation = 18%",
            "### Step 3. Mean-Variance Efficiency Concept",
            "A portfolio is considered mean-variance efficient if, for a given level of risk, it offers the highest possible return, or for a given return, it has the lowest possible risk.",
            "### Step 4. Identifying the Suboptimal Portfolio",
            "- Portfolio 1: Expected Return = 10%, Risk = 14%",
            "- Portfolio 2: Expected Return = 12%, Risk = 13%",
            "- Portfolio 3: Expected Return = 11%, Risk = 12%",
            "- Portfolio 4: Expected Return = 14%, Risk = 18%",
            "Since Portfolio 1 has both a lower return and higher risk than Portfolios 2 and 3, it is not mean-variance efficient.",
            "### Final Answer",
            "Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{A}."
        ],
        "comparison": {
            "incorrect_reasoning": "Initially, the reasoning focused on finding the best portfolio in terms of risk-return trade-off, leading to Portfolio 2 being chosen as the best option. However, the question was asking for the least efficient portfolio, not the best one.",
            "correct_reasoning": "The correct reasoning focuses on identifying the portfolio that is not mean-variance efficient. Portfolio 1 is suboptimal because it has both a lower return and higher risk than Portfolios 2 and 3, making it inefficient.",
            "main_difference": "The key difference was misunderstanding the question's focus—choosing the least efficient portfolio rather than the best one."
        },
        "key_takeaways": [
            "1. Always read the question carefully to understand whether it is asking for the most efficient or the least efficient portfolio.",
            "2. Apply the concept of mean-variance efficiency by comparing portfolios to identify suboptimal ones.",
            "3. Look for portfolios that have both higher risk and lower return compared to others to determine inefficiency.",
            "4. Be mindful of dominance when comparing portfolios—if one portfolio offers both a higher return and lower risk, the other is not efficient."
